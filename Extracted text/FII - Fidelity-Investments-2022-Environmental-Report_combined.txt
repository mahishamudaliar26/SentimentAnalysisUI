Associate Engagement Strategic Partnerships Looking Ahead Fidelity INVESTMENTS Introduction Carbon and Climate Resource Efficiency and Conservation Emissions Breakdown Impact of Hybrid Working Remote and hybrid working arrangements significantly reduced scope 3 emissions as compared to 2019 and earlier (before the COVID-19 pandemic). New ways of working continue to demonstrate that any changes in operational structure will have an impact on emissions patterns. Thus, as the working world continues to change, we may elect to revisit our choice of baseline year, so that future emissions are benchmarked against similar times and similar working conditions. Apex Companies, LLC, provided independent verification of Fidelity's greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1, scope 2, and select scope 3) for the calendar year 2022 - as shown on the chart on page 4. Verification was completed against the World Resources Institute/ World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol and was conducted in accordance with ISO 14064- 3:2019 Greenhouse Gases-Part 3: Specification with Guidance for the Verification and Validation of Greenhouse Gas Statements. * Total kWh and CO2 eq account for production at Fidelity's solar arrays in NC, NH, and RI. ** Business Travel-Misc. consists of hotel stays, rental car mileage, train travel and executive transport. 5 2022 Environmental Report | Fidelity Investments



Strategic Partnerships Looking Ahead Fidelity® INVESTMENTS Introduction Carbon and Climate Resource Efficiency and Conservation Associate Engagement SPOTLIGHT: An Array of Light Location: Westlake, Texas Size: 14 acres Impact: Directly powers Fidelity buildings and is expected to generate 5.7 million kilowatt hours of carbon- free electricity annually. This would be enough electricity to power approximately 528* homes for one year. Our owned and operated solar arrays in Texas, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Rhode Island have helped us make significant strides in lowering our greenhouse gas emissions. In 2022, we finalized construction of our newest solar array in Westlake, Texas. The 14-acre array sits adjacent to Fidelity's Westlake campus and is equipped with a sun-tracking system that allows it to follow the sun throughout the day for maximum energy output. We expect the array to generate 5.7 million kilowatt hours of carbon-free electricity for Fidelity buildings annually. We also took care to preserve the natural environment surrounding the solar array at our Westlake, Texas campus, which includes a 25-acre forest. We planted native flora, such as prairie grasses and wildflowers, to emulate the natural surroundings. Our investments in the Westlake campus have enhanced the local ecosystem and supported biodiversity within the highly developed Texas' Cross Timbers region, creating a habitat for native butterflies, migrating songbirds, and other wildlife, as well as onsite beehives to promote pollination (see "Spotlight: Bee Pollinator Program," page 16). We continue to evaluate onsite solar investment opportunities as we strive to further increase our renewable energy sourcing and foster resilience of our daily business operations. *In previous reports we stated 700 homes. We've amended this number to 528 in accordance with the U.S. Energy Information Administration's updated calculation for average annual electricity consumption in U.S. households in 2022.

Associate Engagement Strategic Partnerships Looking Ahead Fidelity INVESTMENTS Introduction Carbon and Climate Resource Efficiency and Conservation Climate Resilience Fidelity is focused on ensuring business continuity and operational excellence across our physical campuses to provide consistent customer service for our clients and a safe working environment for our associates. Our climate resilience strategy focuses on adapting to the climatic variability we are already experiencing and that is projected to continue. In 2022, Fidelity updated a physical climate risk assessment of our real estate portfolio to understand the impacts of climate change under three global warming scenarios. Using climate models that look at risks from today to the year 2100, we assessed the exposure of Fidelity's sites to the nature, frequency, and severity of the following climate risks: flood, wind, heat, cold, precipitation, fire, and drought. This assessment helps us understand the short- and long-term impacts of climate variability at each of our sites so that we can consider and employ climate adaptation options. We are integrating this climate data in the assessment of new locations for our Investor Centers, and more broadly, factoring climate data into the risk assessments and decision-making processes that inform all of our site management. In 2022, we incorporated climate risk information into the due diligence process for more than 25 Investor Center locations, supporting the operational resiliency of our wealth and retail brokerage businesses.

Fidelity INVESTMENTS Introduction Carbon and Climate Resource Efficiency and Conservation Associate Engagement Strategic Partnerships Looking Ahead Resource Efficiency and Conservation Since 2007, we have reduced our resource consumption across all five of our key environmental metrics: water, waste, energy, carbon, and paper. Fidelity's resource use in 2022 remained lower than pre-pandemic levels, due in part to the hybrid work arrangements where most associates split their time between Fidelity workplaces and home offices. Fidelity continued to mark a reduction in GHG emissions from our real estate operations compared to those years (2019 and earlier) when employees did not work remotely as often. Methodologies that would enable us to fully quantify the impact of remote working on Fidelity's scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions are still under development, but we recognize that observed reductions in Fidelity's carbon emissions may be offset by incrementally higher emissions attributable to home heating and electricity consumption - as well as increased waste generation and water use - by Fidelity associates as they work from home offices. The company's results from 2022 demonstrate that the outsized reductions in energy and natural resource use that we witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic will not persist on their own, as we measured rebounds in energy and carbon emissions, as well as water consumption and waste production across our operating footprint as compared with 2021. Therefore, we remain committed to our comprehensive efforts to keep Fidelity's operational carbon emissions trending downward.

Associate Engagement Strategic Partnerships Looking Ahead Fidelity, INVESTMENTS Introduction Carbon and Climate Paper Reduction Fidelity is a proud champion and leader of digital-first tools for customers that reduce reliance on paper and postage and increase the security and accessibility of investment information. Most of our customers choose to receive communications from us digitally, and all new retail brokerage customers now receive electronic communications by default. In 2022, our outbound paper usage remained flat relative to 2021, reflecting a high volume of regulatory communications required to be delivered in paper form. Fidelity is a leading advocate for modernizing outdated rules to make electronic delivery the default way to receive documents, while preserving investor choice for paper. In 2022, we strongly supported the introduction of the "Improving Disclosure for Investors Act of 2022" in the U.S. House of Representatives, which would direct the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to change the default means of investor communication from paper to digital. We continue to urge Congress and the SEC to modernize outdated regulations to better reflect our customers' preferences and reduce waste.

Fidelity INVESTMENTS Associate Engagement Strategic Partnerships Looking Ahead Introduction Carbon and Climate Responsible Suppliers One of the foundational goals of Fidelity's sustainability program is to precisely measure the environmental impacts of our suppliers. Therefore, in 2021, we established the Responsible Sourcing Office, a division of Fidelity Procurement, to ensure we engage suppliers who align with our efforts to reduce our environmental impact. The Responsible Sourcing Office sets guidelines, policies, and procedures for sustainable purchasing, and establishes processes to assess a potential supplier's environmental strategy. This includes measuring, disclosing, and addressing negative impacts on the environment, such as greenhouse gas emissions, resource consumption, or ecosystem-related impacts (energy, water, raw materials, waste streams and more). Internally, we encourage all Fidelity associates to adhere to sustainable purchasing guidelines when making purchasing decisions, including avoiding single-use products and packaging, opting for biodegradable or recyclable products, and giving preference to local suppliers and suppliers who demonstrate tangible and measurable sustainability goals and commitments. Resource Efficiency and Conservation SPOTLIGHT: Business Travel · Business travel carbon emissions decreased by 47% between 2019 and 2022, largely resulting from reduced travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. · Business travelers at Fidelity are encouraged to "travel with a purpose." This means being mindful of the environmental impact of travel and choosing lower impact options when they are available. · As result of, Fidelity has promoted increased use of high-efficiency aircraft, a reduction in travel on long-haul flights, a reduction in day trips on short-haul flights, and an increase in train travel. While we anticipate some further increases in business travel as in-person engagements become more prevalent, we continue to encourage associates to host meetings virtually, fly on more efficient aircraft, fly direct to their destination, rent economy-sized cars, and choose train travel where available for shorter distances. 10 2022 Environmental Report | Fidelity Investments



Fidelity INVESTMENTS Associate Engagement Strategic Partnerships Looking Ahead Introduction Carbon and Climate Resource Efficiency and Conservation SPOTLIGHT: Onsite Composters Turn Garbage into Gold Locations: Texas, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Kentucky, and North Carolina Food waste diverted from landfills since 2016: 6.1 million pounds Estimated carbon saved to date: 1600 MtCo2e Compost produced: 10,000+ yards Fidelity has been composting onsite food waste, landscape debris, and cardboard since 2016. We currently own and operate five onsite composters and are excited to continue expanding this program. In 2016, Fidelity successfully piloted an onsite composting system in Merrimack, New Hampshire. We worked with Green Mountain Technologies to install the Earth Flow Composter, a 30-yard steel vessel that naturally composts biodegradable material. The program has been expanded to all our owned sites. Material is loaded into the composter, which then undergoes an automated process of mixing and aerating. Automated sprinklers add moisture to the process. The mixing process happens several times a day, as needed. It takes 45 days to fully convert material into usable compost. Our composters divert more than 200 tons of kitchen waste and 40 tons of landscape debris from landfills each year, which amounts to 40% of the total waste stream at our Merrimack campus. This results in significant savings in costs and energy that would otherwise be spent hauling material away. C EARTH FLC On top of the waste reduction benefits of our composting, roughly every 60 days we extract final compost, which provides nutrient-dense nourishment for our campus landscapes and organic farms.

Fidelity INVESTMENTS Associate Engagement Strategic Partnerships Looking Ahead Introduction Carbon and Climate Resource Efficiency and Conservation SPOTLIGHT: Organic Fidelity Farms Locations: Kentucky, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Texas Total acreage: Seven acres Reducing our carbon footprint and helping the environment are not only important initiatives for Fidelity as a firm, but for our associates as well. Scaling onsite organic farms is one example of our commitment to carbon and water reduction. Our organic farms: · Reduce our carbon and water footprint by growing and consuming fresh produce onsite · Reduce shipping and refrigeration needs · Support associate well-being · Provide quality produce to food banks in our communities In 2022, we broke ground on farms in Kentucky, New Hampshire, and Texas, bringing the number of our onsite farms to four. Our first farm started in 2018 in Smithfield, Rhode Island and is the model for our newest farms. The organic produce harvested from our 2.1-acre Rhode Island farm is served in our onsite cafe, and 25% of the produce is donated to the nearby Rhode Island Food Bank. We irrigate the farm with collected rainwater and amend the soil with organic material from our onsite composters. Regenerative farming methods are used to create high-quality produce with minimal environmental impact. Our Texas farm was completed in 2022, and our Kentucky and New Hampshire locations will produce their first harvest in 2023. The on-site organic farm in Merrimack, New Hampshire. On all our farms, we partner with Green City Growers (GCG), an employee-owned benefit corporation to staff, maintain, and provide engagement and programming around the farms. GCG makes recommendations about what should be planted based on location, climate, landscape, and other environmental factors. They also work closely with FLIK, our food service provider, to plan crops. They consider what produce is consumed most in our cafes and the environmental footprint of those items when planning what can be grown locally. 12 2022 Environmental Report | Fidelity Investments

The apiary sits beside a solar array that provides electricity to the Merrimack campus. SPOTLIGHT: Bee Pollinator Program Location: Rhode Island, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Texas, Nebraska, Massachusetts Size: Five apiaries (five hives per apiary) Bees are critical to biodiversity and healthy food systems. As pollinators, bees travel from plant to plant carrying pollen on their bodies, transferring genetic material that allows for countless flowers and other plant species to reproduce. Honeybees, in particular, are known for pollinating a wide variety of plant species. Fidelity hosts honeybee apiaries on our campuses in Rhode Island, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Texas, and, most recently, at our data center in Omaha, Nebraska. We also host a single hive in Boston, Massachusetts. We purposely installed each apiary near our onsite farms so that the bees can help bolster the propagation of local plant species. We work with Best Bees, a Boston-based beekeeping organization, to install and maintain our apiaries. With their help, we track our apiary's growth and honey production. Through DNA analysis of the honey produced, we also track what the bees are feeding on, giving us data that allows us to refine our farming tactics to increase attractiveness of plants to the bees, which in turn, creates more successful pollination and crop reproduction to serve our associates and communities. 16 2022 Environmental Report | Fidelity Investments
