P.7 ABOUT / ENVIRONMENT / HUMAN RIGHTS / ASSOCIATES / COMMUNITY / GOVERNANCE / REFERENCE / FRAMEWORKS 2021 HONORS / EXECUTIVE LETTERS / FORWARD FASHION / OUR COMMITMENTS / OUR BRANDS / OUR PARTNERS A Note From Our CEO "The core of our PVH+ Plan is to win with the consumer in a way that is aligned with our company purpose to power brands that drive fashion forward for good." Looking back on my first year as CEO, 2021 was a year in which we continued to successfully navigate the COVID-19 pandemic while driving toward an accelerated recovery to position PVH to win with the consumer and deliver sustainable, profitable, long-term growth. While the operating environment around us changed dramatically due to the pandemic, our commitment to move our business and the fashion industry toward a more innovative and responsible future did not. Forward Fashion, our global corporate responsibility strategy, continues to be our roadmap for reaching our time-bound commitments in the critical areas of climate change, sustainability and human rights. We also introduced our Inclusion & Diversity commitments, nine specific targets in the pillars of Workplace, Marketplace and Community. These commitments reflect our belief in doing what's right for our associates, consumers and communities at large. As a leader in the fashion industry, we know that our voice can make an impact by being proactive and vocal in calls for racial justice and equity, and by raising awareness and finding solutions with peers to create equity and access for all. Earlier this year, we launched our PVH+ Plan, a multi-year growth plan for unlocking the full potential of our two global iconic brands, Calvin Klein and TOMMY HILFIGER, by connecting them closer to where the consumer is going than at any time before and, importantly, doing so in alignment with our company purpose: to power brands that drive fashion forward for good. A critical part of achieving the PVH+ Plan will be investing in and integrating this purpose into how we work and how we connect with consumers. This is also a business imperative - driving fashion forward for good is in line with the expectations of our consumers, our associates and the communities where we live and work. While we have made great progress, we know there is still much work to be done. With our multi-year growth plan in place, combined with the passion and drive of our associates, we look forward to continuing to contribute meaningfully to creating the future we want - as individuals and society.

P.8 ABOUT / ENVIRONMENT / HUMAN RIGHTS / ASSOCIATES / COMMUNITY / GOVERNANCE / REFERENCE / FRAMEWORKS 2021 HONORS / EXECUTIVE LETTERS / FORWARD FASHION / OUR COMMITMENTS / OUR BRANDS / OUR PARTNERS A Note From Our CSO "To truly drive progress, we must embed sustainability across our business, make required investments against our commitments and effectively collaborate with all stakeholders." In 2021, we made continued progress on our Forward Fashion corporate responsibility strategy and reaffirmed our commitment to drive fashion forward for good, while facing the backdrop of ongoing geopolitical and economic challenges. The year grounded us in the urgency to bring our organization, peers and partners together to create meaningful change for the near- and far-term. We launched Forward Fashion three years ago to create a new level of ambition and transparency for sustainable business. Our 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report reflects the actions we've taken over the last year to drive progress toward our targets, and showcases our continued commitment to transparency as we enhance our capability to report increasingly more data on social and environmental impacts. To truly drive this progress and ensure we remain steadfast in meeting our targets, we are working diligently to embed sustainability across our business. We are investing in new technologies, training associates to design and develop sustainable products, scaling sustainability solutions across our value chain, and more. We will be successful only by working collaboratively with our colleagues and external stakeholders to improve and accelerate our efforts to deliver on the most urgent commitments for our business, the apparel industry and our planet. We are excited to share a few highlights: · Delivering sustainable products to our consumers: By taking learnings from increasing the sustainable attributes in our Calvin Klein and TOMMY HILFIGER collections, we turned our focus to scaled adoption of sustainable materials. We joined the U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol to help increase the availability of sustainable cotton and in 2022 established a multi-year partnership between Tommy Hilfiger and Infinited Fiber to transform waste into new products. · Advancing climate action and human rights across the value chain: We partnered with the Apparel Impact Institute (Aii) to implement a new Carbon Leadership Program to tackle supply chain emissions using a standardized industry approach. Our partnership with Aii allows us to collectively test, scale and replicate carbon reduction programs with our industry peers to achieve our collective carbon goals. We also continue to ensure workers are represented and are at the center of resolving workplace issues, and have expanded our Workplace Cooperation Program in partnership with Better Work to ensure worker voices are heard, fair standards are normalized and suppliers are empowered to manage and improve working conditions. . Increasing transparency to our stakeholders: We are working toward creating a more transparent ecosystem within PVH, with our vendors and partners, as well as with NGOs and governments. We continually seek to be responsive to our stakeholders through increased public reporting and expanded disclosures, including reporting measurable progress toward our targets for the first time in this report. We are excited for the hard work ahead because much more progress is needed to achieve our Forward Fashion ambitions. We understand and recognize our responsibility to make a positive impact for both our stakeholders and our industry.

From the very beginning, we've believed in creating a more sustainable and inclusive brand, while remaining on the pulse of pop culture and heritage fashion. Standing up and taking responsibility by playing our part in creating a future we can be proud of, and look forward to, is more important than ever. This is woven into Tommy Hilfiger's vision to "Waste Nothing and Welcome All" as the brand strives toward 24 ambitious targets spanning across circularity and inclusion by 2030. In line with our Forward Fashion targets, Tommy Hilfiger aims to encompass inclusion and circularity across all its products, operations and experiences. "The time to move from a linear model - take, make, waste - to a circular model, where we reuse, recycle or repurpose - is now. As a brand, it is our job to work with the industry so that we can offer newness without using virgin resources. Consumers are expecting us to facilitate access to a more sustainable lifestyle that aligns with their values."

P.17 ABOUT / ENVIRONMENT / HUMAN RIGHTS / ASSOCIATES / COMMUNITY / GOVERNANCE / REFERENCE / FRAMEWORKS 2021 HONORS / EXECUTIVE LETTERS / FORWARD FASHION / OUR COMMITMENTS / OUR BRANDS / OUR PARTNERS 2021 Highlights We continue to work together and alongside our partners as we drive toward a better future of fashion. Product · Tommy Hilfiger continued to significantly increase use of more sustainable materials, with over 67%8 of materials sustainably sourced globally in 2021. . We met and exceeded our 2025 "Make It Possible" target to finish 50% of denim pieces at a lower impact: 75% of denim products globally, or 4.4 million pieces, were made with lower-impact finishing techniques, reducing water and energy usage. 1 · 63%, or 3.7 million, of our denim pieces in Europe and North America were made with a minimum of 20% post-consumer recycled cotton. · We made our first pieces designed for circularity, which featured one material type to ease future recycling, and experimented with innovative materials such as mycelium and VEGEA as leather alternatives. . We explored a circular business model that was expanded as a pilot from the Netherlands to Denmark, Germany and France, diverting 110,792 pounds of textile waste from landfills since 2020. Through the pilot, products could be taken back, resold, repaired or transformed into new items. · The TOMMY HILFIGER Adaptive collection, available in four regions and thoughtfully designed for children and adults with disabilities, was expanded across product categories to include girls' swimwear, bras and underwear. · In partnership with Romeo Hunte, Indya Moore and Patta, we launched collaborations with gender-inclusive styles and expanded sizes. Community · As part of our People's Place Program, we launched the first "New Legacy Design Challenge" to support emerging Black talent and celebrate a new generation of Black designers, in partnership with Harlem Fashion Row. . The third year of the "TOMMY HILFIGER Fashion Frontier Challenge," an annual accelerator program for impactful and inclusive fashion startups, awarded two finalists a shared prize fund of €200,000, and €15,000 to an audience-voted favorite contestant. To date, we have awarded €580,000 to nine finalists. · We organized the third annual "Make It Possible" Week, in which internal and external changemakers discussed, shared and educated on circularity, inclusion and innovation-related topics. While we made strides in 2021, there is still significant work to be done. We are in this for the long run and will continue innovating until our goals are met. 8.

P.18 ABOUT / ENVIRONMENT / HUMAN RIGHTS / ASSOCIATES / COMMUNITY / GOVERNANCE / REFERENCE / FRAMEWORKS / OUR PARTNERS 2021 HONORS / EXECUTIVE LETTERS / FORWARD FASHION / OUR COMMITMENTS / OUR BRANDS Tommy Hilfiger was awarded an Outstanding Achievement Award by the British Fashion Council for his exceptional contribution to the global fashion industry in creating an inclusive brand. This award recognized his pioneering work, including: · TOMMY HILFIGER Adaptive: a clothing line thoughtfully designed for children and adults with disabilities. · The "TOMMY HILFIGER Fashion Frontier Challenge": a global program to find and support the new ideas that are making the fashion landscape more inclusive. · The People's Place Program: created to support the representation of Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) within the creative industries, focusing on partnerships, career access and industry leadership. Through the People's Place Program, Tommy Hilfiger teamed up with the Brooklyn-born designer Romeo Hunte to create a collection called Icons, Reconstructed. Inspired by the New York City subway, the collection featured Hunte's signature deconstruction techniques and put a new spin on classic TOMMY HILFIGER styles. "Artists like Romeo Hunte deserve all the support our industry leaders can offer. As one of his proud mentors, I can absolutely say that the inspiration goes both ways." Tommy Hilfiger "Tommy and I have been working together for years; our collections are about challenging the status quo and redefining the future. My experience as a Black designer has made me very invested in sharing my own experiences to inspire and guide the designers of the future to follow their dreams."

A well-made pair of jeans can last decades - passed from one owner to another, adapted to seasons and outfits and tailored for trends that come and go. With this in mind, we seek to build longevity and circularity into every stage of a garment's life cycle, understanding that a solidly constructed and loved garment can last a lifetime: · Starting with design - We are piloting circular design principles that incorporate sustainable materials and ensure products are ready for reuse or recycling at end of life. · Through a garment's life - We are exploring recommerce models to extend a garment's life for as many wears as possible. . And beyond the final wear - We plan to test and scale textile recycling to turn textile waste into new clothing. While we've initially focused on three products, we're evolving our approach to focus on elements of the product development life cycle in order to improve circularity and efficiency across all our products. We plan to consult with our NGO partners and circularity experts to refine and restate our circularity target in 2023. Notable Progress . Piloted and launched the PVH Circular Design Framework for Tommy Hilfiger teams in Europe. · Piloted recommerce and downcycling programs, including a product takeback initiative to determine what material is received and test resale on B-stock and upcycling damaged goods; these pilots gave new life to over 4,000 gently used clothing items that were collected from our associates during a takeback program pilot. · 87 associates from 11 countries submitted designs for an upcycled clothing item or accessory that a PVH brand could sell as part of our Upcycling Design Challenge. · Since 2020, 110,792 pounds of textile waste has been diverted from landfills through a circularity initiative in which pre-loved or damaged TOMMY HILFIGER products could be taken back, repaired, resold or transformed into new items. Circularity at PVH Our teams are aligned on what circularity means for PVH. Informed by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Cradle to Cradle and Textile Exchange, PVH defines a circular product as one that is: · Designed with safe and renewable materials. · Made to be made again. · Based on new business models to extend the life of clothing and capture rental and resale market share. · Underpinned by traceability and transparency, which are crucial to unlocking circular product and business models at scale.

P.28 ABOUT / ENVIRONMENT / HUMAN RIGHTS / ASSOCIATES / COMMUNITY / GOVERNANCE / REFERENCE / FRAMEWORKS MATERIALS / CIRCULARITY / CARBON / WASTE & PACKAGING / ENVIRONMENTALLY ETHICAL SOURCING / CHEMICALS & MICROFIBERS / WATER Making the Old New Again Through Recycling Innovations The transition to a circular economy presents several challenges, one being the lack of knowledge about the chemical content within post-consumer recycled textiles. Through our partnerships, we're testing and piloting the scalability of technologies and solutions to these challenges. PVH's First Circular Business Model In Europe, Tommy Hilfiger is exploring ways to keep products in use longer through our first circular business model. This model allows customers to bring back pre-loved or damaged TOMMY HILFIGER products to be repaired, resold or transformed into new items. Since 2020, 110,792 pounds of textile waste has been diverted from landfills, and the model expanded from the Netherlands to Denmark, Germany and France. This greater reach allows us to further test and gain insights into consumer needs, habits and shopping preferences. For example, we partnered with Fashion for Good to launch the Full Circle Textiles Project, which seeks to validate and scale promising technologies in polyester chemical recycling, and to encourage financing and offtake commitments in the fashion industry. Through the project, apparel companies collaborated to bring structure to the innovation process, test their output with industry experts and best enable the scaling of circularity technologies. As part of the project, PVH piloted a chemical recycling program using regenerated cellulosic fibers from Renewcell, Infinited Fiber Company, Circ and Evrnu, which we upcycled into yarn, fabric and finished goods. THE JEANS REDESIGN THESE JEANS WERE CREATED USING THE JEANS REDESIGN GUIDELINES, AN INITIATIVE THAT ENSURES WE WORK TOGETHER AS AN INDUSTRY TO CREATE CIRCULAR AND DURABLE DENIM. We also conducted a pilot of our PVH Circular Design Framework for Tommy Hilfiger teams in Europe, which gave designers nine circular design strategies with performance indicators and guidance on how to achieve each strategy. PVH will gather learnings from the pilot and determine a global training plan for relevant associates starting in 2023. Additionally, PVH co-founded an international sustainable fashion cooperative with Bestseller to bring mycelium innovations from design firm Ecovative to market.

Our ambition is for our business operations to generate zero waste and to diminish the waste generated by our products. We will focus on achieving this by: 1. Testing and applying alternative options for packaging materials, starting with plastic polybags used in e-commerce. 2. Diverting waste from stores, distribution centers and offices by establishing and tracking against baselines and setting standards to embed into PVH's general facility management and procurement practices. 3. Educating and enabling employee behavior change, particularly related to reuse and recycling. Notable Progress · In North America, retail shopping bags were transitioned to being 100% recyclable and compostable, made from Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified paper and post- consumer waste (PCW) or recycled content; TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein retail shopping bags were composed of 100% and 40% recycled content, respectively. · Piloted two types of sustainable hangers made from 100% recycled content and 70% recycled content, respectively, for use in Calvin Klein stores. Packaging Packaging represents a huge opportunity for PVH to reduce our negative environmental impacts. Through our partnership with Canopy, we've committed to reducing usage of wood-derived materials from ancient or endangered forests by 2022 by increasing paper products sourced from responsibly managed forests and by using recycled content. Currently, 37% of PVH's total paper packaging weight is recycled paper. As a member of Canopy's Pack4Good initiative, we're working to reduce overall paper and paper packaging material volumes, and commit to purchasing paper products that meet the following criteria: 1) Certified as being sourced from responsibly managed forests, with a preference for FSC certification, and 2) Made with a minimum of 50% PCW or recycled content. PVH is also a member of the AFIRM RSL Packaging committee. In 2021, PVH launched the Heron Preston for Calvin Klein collaboration featuring plastic-free packaging. In our Calvin Klein North America business, we successfully transitioned men's underwear boxes from plastic to paper composed of at least 50% recycled content. This eliminated the usage of 650,000 pounds of plastic from on- product packaging, equivalent to over 31 million standard-size plastic water bottles. In 2022, we will focus on procuring sustainable polybags, as an alternative to the plastic options typically used in e-commerce, to mail products to consumers or ship products from our suppliers to retail stores and wholesale partners. Waste In 2020 and 2021, we opted not to conduct a waste audit of our owned and operated waste data, as we recognized it would not reflect our normal operations due to COVID- related store and office closures. In Europe, we are conducting a baseline for waste in 2022 and plan to share these results. We also continue to explore new ways to reduce waste. Our partnership with Fashion for Good provides our teams with waste reduction resources to better inform pilots that will ultimately drive industrywide progress toward eliminating single-use plastics and reducing waste across our supply chains. In 2021, 63% of PVH's on-product packaging was made of paper; of this, 37% was made of recycled materials and 79% was certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. 30% of all on-product packaging was made of recycled materials (up from 0% in 2019).

We support workers in our supply chain and their right to advocate for their well- being. In 2021 we expanded our "Workplace Cooperation Program" (WCP) in partnership with Better Work. The program improves cooperation and communication between managers and workers in manufacturing facilities, so that worker voices are amplified, fair standards are normalized and suppliers are empowered to manage and improve working conditions. WCP uses a "train the trainer" model to ensure that necessary trainings can spread across supplier networks. Through the program, we provide suppliers with training and advisory services to establish workplace committees and promote worker engagement, and suppliers are able to give their own facility-level trainings after receiving these lessons. In 2021, we focused on training strategic suppliers who can operationalize these trainings across their factory bases over the next three years, which will significantly accelerate progress toward our target. Notable Progress · Trained 15 key Tier 1 suppliers, who in turn led 77 trainings across their factory bases. · Grew participation in the WCP and Better Work's Advisory Services to enroll a total of 120 manufacturing facilities, representing 57% of total applicable facilities in 2021, an increase from 38% in 2020; increased participation will strengthen worker management committees. Credibly Managing Grievances Through the WCP, we work closely with suppliers to support the development and implementation of their own robust grievance mechanisms for employees. In addition, Tell PVH, our global reporting hotline, is another way we ensure worker voices and concerns are heard. Tell PVH is available to all global PVH associates and workers in our supply chain.

We partner with our suppliers to ensure migrant workers are recruited ethically and do not pay any recruitment fees. The payment of recruitment fees to intermediaries is a widely recognized indicator of forced labor, so we focus on working directly with suppliers to empower them to prevent the practice of soliciting recruitment fees by providing education and resources. We are proud to have seen a significant decrease in recruitment fee issues in our supply chain in 2021: 99% of our suppliers were found not to have any evidence of recruitment fees paid by migrant workers. Through the audit process, which is deployed in high-risk countries, we found four cases of noncompliance, down from 16 cases in 2020 - a 75% decrease. This is driven by improvements in our tracking around recruitment fees and expansion of due diligence and procedures to address instances of noncompliance. To ensure our suppliers are empowered to be part of the solution, we train them to establish procedures to effectively identify and remediate recruitment fee issues, and enact management systems to prevent the charge of recruitment fees when migrant workers are initially recruited for employment. Notable Progress · 99% of our suppliers had no evidence of recruitment fees paid by migrant workers. · Secured supplier reimbursement of US $145,000 to 81 workers - on average each worker received US$1,790, more than doubling our reimbursement rate from the prior year. · Launched internal resources and trainings for PVH CR team members focused on fee case management and remediation. · Developed and improved monitoring mechanisms to facilitate data collection, analysis and case tracking. · Expanded supplementary audit in high-risk countries for enhanced due diligence and data collection. ... 2 KONCO PVH ranked third out of 37 apparel and footwear companies in KnowTheChain's 2021 benchmark, which measures performance on addressing forced labor in supply chains.

Program, a comprehensive learning program that covers topics such as communication and leadership skills, financial literacy, water sanitation and hygiene practices, general and reproductive health and more. We partner with strategic suppliers to embed the program within their personnel management systems, thus ensuring program continuity and supplier ownership. Using a supplier collaboration model, we build communities of practice by pairing existing P.A.C.E. suppliers with suppliers new to the program to train their trainers and provide guidance. Through the program, women can obtain the knowledge and resources they need to succeed in their personal and professional lives. Since launching in 2019, we have extended it within our supply chain communities and are continuing to scale in Bangladesh via a five-year, $5 million joint collaboration with USAID and CARE. We plan to expand the program to Turkey, Tunisia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Egypt in 2022. Collaborating for Equality At the community level, as part of our dedication to removing barriers for women and creating enabling environments, we entered into a partnership with the Power of Nutrition in Bangladesh and deployed the P.A.C.E. training in community programs in Ethiopia. We also partner with peer companies and global multi-stakeholder initiatives to harmonize industry approaches, and to ensure women in factories and communities have access to learning programs and services. In 2021, alongside other top fashion companies, we joined the Generation Equality Forum, where global stakeholders from UN agencies, government, the private sector and civil society defined a global roadmap for gender equality that aims to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals outlined in the Beijing Platform for Action. In the forum, PVH made a joint commitment to the Resilience Fund for Women in Global Value Chains, with brands such as Gap, H&M and Ralph Lauren, as part of the Economic Justice and Rights, Gender-based Violence, and Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights and Bodily Autonomy Action Coalitions. With this commitment, PVH joins a global corporate community promoting gender equality, and is contributing to the $40 billion being raised in financial support. Scaling Services for Women: Project Thrive PVH is rapidly scaling our women's empowerment efforts through a $5 million, five- year collaboration with USAID Bangladesh and CARE. Project Thrive will provide holistic services for over 100,000 women and other marginalized individuals in factories and communities - services such as P.A.C.E., technical skills training, COVID-19 education, advocacy trainings, job placement and gender-based violence assistance referral services. In 2021, PVH worked with USAID and CARE to formulate Project Thrive, which will launch in 2022. Working in a phased approach with CARE over the next five years, PVH will engage suppliers to embed the P.A.C.E. program into factory management approaches. Together the two organizations will teach on-staff trainers and extend career enhancement programs to help women advance in the workplace, as well as provide training to help connect marginalized community members with employment opportunities.

As part of its oversight, the Board receives periodic reports from members of senior management on various aspects of risk, including our enterprise risk management program, business continuity planning and cybersecurity. Each Board committee oversees the management of risks that fall within its area of responsibility, as summarized in the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders Proxy Statement. In performing this function, each committee has full access to management, as well as the authority to engage advisors. Committee chairs report on their committees' activities and can raise any risk issues, including agenda items related to risk, at each Board meeting following a committee meeting, where all directors can engage in a discussion and consideration of these risks.

Managing CR Risks Under the guidance of the Board's CR Committee, we aim to expand our CR governance approach in 2022 to adopt a more holistic approach to risk management for the business. We are conducting a climate risk assessment in line with guidelines from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, as well as a water risk assessment in cooperation with WWF. These efforts will tie into our enterprise risk strategy and build upon refinements we made to the strategy in 2021. In 2021, following Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) due diligence guidance, we further improved our process to identify and assess actual and potential adverse impacts associated with the enterprise's operations, products and services. We piloted the Sustainable Business Risk Assessment (SBRA) process, which assesses the actual and potential adverse impacts of PVH's business on rights holders and the environment. Our SBRA analytical framework covers both PVH's owned and operated facilities, as well as the supply chain from raw materials to finished products. For our analysis, we used both qualitative and quantitative data, including, but not limited to, PVH CR assessment data, third-party risk indices and other data sources related to stakeholder engagement. Through the the SBRA analysis, risks of adverse impacts are prioritized from a salient issue list based on a scorecard. The criteria for prioritization are developed following the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector, and focus on the severity and likelihood of the adverse impacts. 2021 SBRA Salient Issues: · Human Rights: Wages & Severance, Freedom of Association & Collective Bargaining, Gender-Based Violence & Harassment · Environment: Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Solid Waste & Hazardous Waste, Hazardous Chemicals, Deforestation Given PVH's commitment to furthering our work in line with the OECD Due Diligence Guidelines, and in preparation for emerging and enacted legislative initiatives in various parts of the globe, we recognize that there is still more work to be done to comprehensively assess adverse impacts, and we are committed to continuing to improve upon our risk assessment processes.

P.66 ABOUT / ENVIRONMENT / HUMAN RIGHTS / ASSOCIATES / COMMUNITY / GOVERNANCE / REFERENCE / FRAMEWORKS BOARD OF DIRECTORS / RISK OVERSIGHT / MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT Materiality Assessment In 2022, we conducted a materiality assessment to help us continue to identify, manage and report on the issues impacting our business and that are of importance to our stakeholders. The assessment process involved engaging stakeholders across our company and beyond with the aim of understanding which material topics are top of mind for the near- and long-term. This collaborative process resulted in a list of 23 topics, principally relating to environmental, social and governance matters, that were designated as being most material to PVH. This list will serve as one of the key inputs in evolving our CR strategy and governance efforts going forward. We will report on related progress as and to the extent appropriate based, in part, on their materiality to us and to our stakeholders. · Sustainable Materials . Health and Safety Inclusion & Diversity . Human Rights in the Supply Chain · Chemicals Management Energy and Emissions Management Climate Change Resiliance · Waste Management · Traceability . Business Ethics and Integrity Water . Living Wages in the Supply Chain · Circularity Assessment Process Topic Identification: Our approach considered both internal and external sources, while remaining focused on our vision of driving fashion forward for good. Internal sources included our our previous CR Reports, previous materiality assessment (2018), employee and consumer surveys and various investor-related publications. External sources included sustainability reporting frameworks and rating agencies (Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), MSCI and World Economic Forum (WEF)), as well as peer benchmarking and key stakeholders, including IndustriALL. Responsible Sourcing Importance to Stakeholders Prioritization: Topics were prioritized using a multi-capital approach that considers whether a topic impacts or is important to various forms of capital that drive value for our operations. Types of capital considered include financial, operational, natural, human, and social and relationship. · Community Investment · Biodiversity · Compensation and Benefits Data Privacy · Taxes Validation: Topics were validated and adjusted through consultation with both internal and external stakeholders. · Anti-competitive Behavior · Advocacy Impact on Business · Talent Management · Cyber Security PVH CORP. / 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

In addition, PVH conducts presourcing assessments at all Level 1 factories before they are allowed to produce any products for us. We also conduct presourcing assessments at certain key Level 2 factories. In addition, we conduct regular audits at all Level 1 and key Level 2 factories once production begins, work closely with factories to remediate any identified deficiencies and, when necessary, terminate supplier factories that fail to comply with our policies, procedures or guidelines. Audits are conducted by reputable third-party auditors, typically every 12 to 24 months. Several factors, including the results of the previous audit, dictate audit frequency.

| To drive fashion forward for good, we cannot stop at simply reducing our negative impacts; we must work to eliminate them. Our ambition is for our business operations to generate zero waste, zero carbon emissions and zero hazardous chemicals, and for our products to be circular. We take a holistic approach to environmental stewardship, meaning we seek to assess our impacts across a product's full life cycle, while imagining and creating solutions that make a meaningful difference to the planet. |  |

| As we look ahead, transparency in climate disclosure and public-facing reporting is becoming more integrated into our business strategy. In 2022, we plan to complete a climate risk scenario analysis, which will give us a broader understanding of the vulnerabilities our company faces due to climate change, and where we need to focus our efforts and overall business strategy to mitigate those impacts and inform sustainable decision-making throughout PVH.                                            |  |
