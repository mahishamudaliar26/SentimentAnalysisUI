| ABOUT THIS REPORT | NOTES FROM OUR LEADERSHIP | OUR STORIES 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT INTRODUCTION | OUR BRANDS | PRIORITIES & PROGRESS ABOUT PVH | APPENDICES | OUR FORWARD FASHION STRATEGY 6 A Note From Our CEO 2020 has been a year like no other in recent history. While our company and the industry were focused on navigating the COVID-19 pandemic and responding to urgent societal issues, PVH also continued to drive forward with a renewed sense of urgency on our commitments to use our scale and global presence to transform ourselves and the industry. Through the power and passion of PVH's people, we made notable progress across key initiatives on inclusion and diversity, environmental sustainability, human rights and climate change. These areas of focus and our values are at the heart of everything we do. Our Corporate Responsibility (CR) Report for 2020 focuses on the issues we believe are critical to creating the future we want-as individuals, communities and society-together with our stakeholders. We also believe it is important to be transparent and measure our progress in delivering on our purpose to drive fashion forward for good. In the report, you will read about the ongoing work of our brands, which continues to further our efforts. Each consumer-facing program is designed to have meaningful outcomes, grounded in their distinctive brand identity, and powered by Forward Fashion, our global CR strategy. It is a privilege and a responsibility for companies like PVH to use our scale and global reach to make a difference on these important issues. We also understand that we will only achieve real and lasting change by working with our peers, partners and the industry as a whole. Among the collaborative efforts we are proud to be a part of: · CFDA: We expanded our partnership with the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) to co-author the State of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in Fashion report, including research and a roadmap for next steps to create a more representative and equitable workforce, talent pipeline and consumer base. It is a step on our journey to improve workplace opportunities for all. · ILO: We worked alongside industry partners and peers to create and endorse the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Call to Action, to protect garment workers during the pandemic, ensure purchasing practice commitments are made to pay for finished and work-in-progress goods, and establish long-term sustainable systems of social protection. · Fashion Pact: As environmental and social priorities rise to the forefront of industry agendas, the Fashion Pact, an initiative spearheaded by the CEOs of over 60 fashion and textile companies, released its first report and established clear targets to drive positive change in the areas of air, oceans and animals through industry collaboration. · America Is All In: Global cross-sector partnership is key to achieving our Forward Fashion goals. PVH is proud to stand alongside our peers and partners in support of climate action, and endorse America Is All In, calling for a national mobilization on climate and recovery as we marked the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement. Stefan Larsson Chief Executive Officer We will continue to build on our core strengths, connect to our consumers in ways that are meaningful to them, and remain dedicated to innovation and continuous improvement. I could not be prouder of our entire team and the spirit they demonstrate every day, as together we work to drive fashion forward for good and co-create the next chapter of PVH's future.



7 ABOUT PVH | ABOUT THIS REPORT | A Note From Our Chief Sustainability Officer | OUR STORIES | APPENDICES 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT INTRODUCTION | OUR BRANDS | PRIORITIES & PROGRESS NOTES FROM OUR LEADERSHIP | OUR FORWARD FASHION STRATEGY We launched our Corporate Responsibility strategy Forward Fashion in 2019 with a vision to establish a new level of ambition and transparency for sustainable business. In 2020, in the face of a global health crisis and increasing economic, social and political polarization, our vision took on a renewed sense of urgency. The events of the past year affected our people, our business and supply chain, our families and communities-and the impacts continue to be felt around the world. It exposed the fragility of many of our global systems, and left organizations navigating the balance of taking immediate actions to prioritize health, safety and business survival, with maintaining focus on the efforts needed not only to recover but thrive as a business as we move forward. These defining moments reinforced that efficiency and resiliency need to be built into all of our systems if we're to be successful and emerge even stronger. Establishing resilient systems is only possible through authentic leadership and embracing collaboration across the entire value chain. While we had to adapt our short-term strategies to address immediate needs across our organization, we were able to draw on our Forward Fashion strategy and the strength of our partnerships to inform the apparel industry's future. I am proud of the progress we have driven forward, from working across the apparel sector to create and endorse The International Labour Organization (ILO) Call to Action, to partnering with our suppliers to accelerate the adoption of industry tools to measure and improve social and environmental performance, and joining over 300 companies in the LEAD on climate initiative to continue to prioritize climate action. "IF 2020 HAS TAUGHT US ANYTHING, IT'S THAT WE MUST CONTINUE TO MAKE ADVANCEMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO ULTIMATELY DELIVER ON THE NEEDS OF ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND PUSH MEANINGFUL PROGRESS BOTH AT PVH AND ACROSS THE INDUSTRY." This year's CR report reflects on these notable actions and honors our commitment to accountability and transparency through the ongoing disclosure of extensive data. It also allows us to indicate the work we have ahead of us and what is to come. Aligning on a strategy and setting targets is never a complete journey but, rather, an evolving one. While Forward Fashion remains our guiding vision, if 2020 has taught us anything, it's that we must continue to make advancements and improvements across our programming, priorities and approach to non-financial reporting, to ultimately deliver on the needs of all our stakeholders and push meaningful progress both at PVH and across the industry. Mansie Peguei le Jonen Marissa Pagnani McGowan Chief Sustainability Officer Working to drive this critical progress will always bring with it challenges and considerations. The rapid growth of digital tools and innovations for circularity needs to account for the workers who comprise our industry's uniquely human supply chain. Developments in recycled materials must evolve alongside green chemistry and sustainable farming practices. These challenges are not easy, yet fashion has always had the ability to reinvent and renew, and this is what motivates all of us to strive for impactful solutions, unlock new opportunities, and continue to drive fashion forward-for good.



OUR STORIES | APPENDICES | NOTES FROM OUR LEADERSHIP | OUR FORWARD FASHION STRATEGY 2020 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT INTRODUCTION | OUR BRANDS | PRIORITIES & PROGRESS | ABOUT PVH | ABOUT THIS REPORT Our FORWARD FASHION Strategy 8 We believe that brilliant design and creative solutions are not just reserved for the clothes we make but also for the way we make them. There is a story woven into every piece we create. It is the story of the fingers that pick the cotton, the hands that spin the fabric and the communities where they are crafted. A story about how the materials are selected, how our factories are powered and their impact on people and the environment. A story about the kind of business we are and the one we want to be. Forward Fashion is our strategy to transform how clothes are made and (re)used, and the actions we will take to move our business and the fashion industry toward a more innovative and responsible future. We are committed to our strategy that supports sustainability and human rights around the world. Through Forward Fashion, we aim to reduce our negative impacts to zero, increase positive impacts to 100% and improve the over 1 million lives throughout our value chain: our associates and supply chain workers, their families and their communities. The fashion industry is changing and, at PVH, we recognize our responsibility and opportunity to drive fashion forward-for good.

Driven by a passion for breaking conventions and embracing bold ideas, the company has written the rule book for remaining at the forefront of the intersection of pop culture and heritage fashion. From the very beginning, Tommy Hilfiger has always believed that with hard work and a positive outlook, anything is possible. So, we are taking action to build towards a better fashion industry. Today, we face some of the biggest challenges we have ever experienced-from climate change and natural resource scarcity to racism and inequity. We recognize that one fashion company cannot change all of this. But we can change the way we work and the clothes our consumers wear. Stitch-by-stitch. Person-by-person. Innovation-by-innovation. We are going to make this vision a reality. We do not know exactly how we will get there but we are determined to try. Over the last decade we have made considerable progress on our sustainability journey and we look forward to accelerating it over the coming months and years. We know this is just the beginning and there is much more work to be done on our journey to create fashion that "Wastes Nothing and Welcomes All."

Our teams are committed to protecting the community and its resources, with a focus on water stewardship. The Protecting Lake Hawassa initiative- launched in 2018 in partnership with Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)-addresses solid waste management, afforestation and soil erosion control, and community and stakeholder engagement to protect the lake. With access to safely managed water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) becoming increasingly critical amidst COVID-19, WASH plays a key role in helping reduce risk of outbreaks and slow the spread of coronavirus. To improve access to WASH services, our teams supported NatuRes and the Hawassa Water Supply and Sewerage Service Enterprise (HWSSSE) in sourcing two submersible water pumps and one surface water pump.

Together, we focused on finding solutions for workers' immediate needs as well as contributing to long- term efforts to strengthen social protections in key garment exporting countries. READ: PVH Corp. Statement on COVID-19 Supply Chain Impact CT We helped create and endorsed the ILO Call to Action, which is now supported by over 120 organizations from peer brands to global trade unions. The group focused on three priority areas: (i) Protecting garment workers' income, health, and employment; (ii) helping ensure that purchasing practice commitments were made to pay for all finished and work-in-progress goods and (iii) establishing long-term, sustainable systems of social protection as we move toward recovery. Collectively, the initiative helped provide $4.9 million in worker wage support in Ethiopia and €115 million ($136 million) disbursed to workers in Bangladesh. As we emerge from COVID-19, the ILO Call to Action will seek to work with governments and key stakeholders to ensure these social protections, such as unemployment insurances, are established in priority countries. Our workers' health and safety remain a priority for PVH. At the outset of the crisis, we issued Guidelines for a Healthy Work Environment and Addressing the COVID-19 Crisis-based on World Health Organization (WHO) and other international guidelines-to our supply chain business partners and provided COVID-19 supplier training addressing health and safety considerations. A key part of our ongoing factory assessment process-which all suppliers must undergo-is focused on health and safety. Through our established issues- management process, we have a team that works with suppliers on risk mitigation and monitoring, addressing and resolving any reported issues- including receipt of wages, benefits and legally mandated severance payments by workers, factory closures, and health impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable worker populations. ENVIR HEALTHY READ: CR Guidelines for a Healthy Work Environment ENT This global crisis has underscored the importance of responsible business practices and the benefits of investing in strategic supply chain partnerships. Now, as the industry regains momentum, continual embedding of these practices across operations, in sourcing decisions and the planned incorporation of compliance cost will prove critical to ensure that we are building a more just and resilient global apparel supply chain. PRIORITIZING CLIMATE ACTION IN COVID-19 RECOVERY The awareness and urgency to learn from the pandemic and work together to tackle the climate crisis has never been greater. Throughout 2020, we have continued to engage with our suppliers and invest in crucial energy efficiency programming to drive environmental improvements as we work towards our Forward Fashion goals. Alongside other global business leaders, we are committed to leveraging our voice and influence to inform policy changes and drive action as we build back better. For instance, we signed the United Nations Global Compact "Statement from business leaders for renewed global cooperation," advocating for multilateral partnerships to actively tackle the global climate crisis and address social inequality and racial injustice. The commitment serves as a pledge to partner with the UN, government, civil society and each other to create an enabling environment that serves the interest of people and planet, prosperity and purpose, through international cooperation and partnership-needed now more than ever. We also signed RE100's Letter to EU policymakers in 2020, joining more than 50 major companies to call for corporate renewables to be built into the EU's COVID-19 economic stimulus package. The letter, signed by many of Europe's largest energy buyers and suppliers, addressed the EU Green Deal's 2050 climate targets TE ADVO CACY and called for further detail and expansion to drive toward a goal of climate neutrality.

Our people are our greatest asset and, like many of our peers, we had difficult conversations and faced tough decisions in our efforts to navigate the COVID-19 crisis effectively and protect those whose hard work and dedication drive us. We implemented a Global Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to support associates directly impacted by the pandemic, covered the private healthcare contributions of team members in the U.S., Canada and Brazil, and provided COVID-19 testing at no cost to all associates. We also provided access to telemedicine services and free flu shots to associates who did not have coverage under our benefit plans. To provide financial support to associates diagnosed with COVID-19 and suffering financial hardship as a result, we expanded the reach of our Associate Relief Fund. READ: About our work to support associates during 2020 ADAPTING TO NEW WAYS OF WORKING Guided by the needs of our associates, we developed new virtual work guidelines and implemented our Flexible Workplace Program, allowing teams to flex their day-to-day schedules to accommodate a new normal. Our weekly benefits digital newsletter kept associates up-to-date as we expanded and adjusted to provide as much ongoing support as possible, including gifting a two-year membership to Headspace-a virtual mental health and wellness platform-to encourage individual well-being. As we look toward an eventual transition back to our offices, we recognize that accountability from our leadership and our associates is key to ensuring a safe environment for our teams. To support this, we have partnered with PVH University to develop training on new COVID-safe policies and protocols to protect our teams as they return to the workplace gradually. TOMI LEANS In line with PVH COVID-safe protocols, a number of associates worked from our offices for business-critical tasks.

Stores generally were operated at reduced hours and occupancy levels, and we adapted the retail experiences, as well as expanded our digital commerce capabilities, to provide consumers with options for safe shopping. DIVERTING WASTE FROM LANDFILL While COVID-19 accelerated many sustainability efforts across our industry, it also led to some intensified environmental impacts. In the face of shifting consumer demands and a marked decrease in in-store traffic, management of excess materials and product-a major sustainability roadblock in our industry-was forcefully brought to the forefront. To address this issue, we updated our Waste Disposal Standard Operating Procedures, warehoused materials and product for future seasons, and collaborated with our partners at Fashion for Good and Plug and Play to identify alternative uses. While this work was initially started to address an immediate challenge, early success has helped inform a future roadmap for ongoing education and innovation on product design and reuse. These principles support our circularity goals and are unlocking sustainable and efficient business opportunities to reimagine material and product waste across our brands.

Our I&D work is an ongoing evolution that requires a commitment from all of us. The global pandemic and the social justice movement heightened our awareness and the need to accelerate our progress. We recognize this is a pivotal moment where we must focus on creating meaningful and sustainable change that impacts not only PVH but our industry at large. As part of our journey, we continue to be transparent and share our progress along the way. We are dedicated to cultivating an environment where every individual is valued, and every voice is heard. In our efforts to foster a workplace culture where all associates feel empowered to be themselves and can count on us to provide opportunities for advancement and growth, we are guided by our values-Integrity, Individuality, Accountability, Passion, and Partnership. Over the past year, we identified areas of greatest impact where we live and work, aligning them to the three pillars of our I&D strategy: the workplace, our marketplace and our communities. We also elevated our Global I&D Council, chaired by PVH CEO Stefan Larsson, to hold ourselves accountable to be both global in scope and transparent in our progress. Accordingly, the Council is responsible for: · Owning and overseeing the global I&D strategy. . Setting the strategic direction for the PVH I&D team and guidance for regional councils. · Ensuring I&D focus areas are aligned with, and embedded in, PVH business strategy. · Championing I&D initiatives across PVH. We appointed Lance LaVergne to the new role of Chief Diversity Officer and SVP of Global Talent Acquisition and Associate Experience in August 2020. He is responsible for leading the development and implementation of an integrated global I&D strategy for PVH. Under his leadership, we established nine commitments that span the framework of our strategic I&D pillars to deliver the inclusive future we are championing. Ranging from inclusive representation to awareness and access, these goals are largely global, reflecting our rich, regional diversity.

As a leader in the fashion industry, we believe that our voice can be a huge influence in bringing awareness to opportunities and finding solutions with our peers to create equity for all. In 2020, we also expanded our partnership with the Council of Fashion Designers of America to co-author the State of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in Fashion report, a definitive work of research that delves deeper into the barriers to greater inclusion and diversity in the fashion industry and identifies tangible actions industry participants can undertake to be more representative and equitable in their workforce, talent pipeline and consumer base. We know we still have work to do and are dedicated to establishing tools and resources to power the initiatives and efforts needed to meet these goals. Members of our Global Inclusion & Diversity Council serve as the executive sponsors of each of our nine commitments. As we reach each milestone, we will evolve them into new commitments to continue to push us forward. WORKPLACE Inclusive Representation: 1. Achieve gender parity globally in all leadership positions at the SVP level and above by 2026. 2. Increase total BIPOC representation at SVP level and above by 50% and double Black and Hispanic/Latinx representation at Director and VP levels in the U.S. by 2026. Our goal is for PVH associates to reflect the diversity of our consumers in communities around the world where we live and work, and to create opportunities for women and underrepresented populations, including BIPOC, LGBTQIA+ and individuals with diverse abilities. In some egions there are data privacy laws that govern the use of associate information, so we will begin our efforts by addressing gender representation globally and racial and ethnic representation in the U.S. These representation commitments are aspirational in nature and are based on the representation of qualified candidates in our talent pipelines, both internal and external. Diverse Candidate Slate: 3. Implement a diverse candidate slate requirement for all Director level and above roles in the U.S. by 2021 YE, then expand globally where we can. Who we hire, and how we hire them, has a significant impact on diversity at PVH. To ensure that we are considering the best and most talented people available, we will aim to have 50% of all candidates interviewed at the Director level and above represent at least one dimension of diversity such as gender, BIPOC, LGBTQIA+ or diverse abilities. This practice will start in the U.S., with the intention of expanding it as broadly as possible globally, and we will focus on those associate levels that provide the greatest opportunities to enhance representation. Retention and Development: 4. Establish and implement formal mentoring programs, resources and tools globally for women, racially/ethnically diverse and other underrepresented groups by 2021 YE. Active mentorship positively affects retention and development, and underrepresented groups have not always had the same access to effective mentorship. This year we will establish and deploy formal global mentoring programs and guidance for women and underrepresented associate populations in their respective regions. Culture of Inclusivity: 5. Deliver unconscious bias training globally to all PVH associates by 2022. Everyone at PVH-associates, managers and leaders-must understand their role in establishing and maintaining an inclusive work environment in order to effect organizational change. Unconscious bias training programs teach greater self-awareness to address and manage hidden biases and reduce their negative effects on workplace decisions and diversity and inclusion efforts. This mandatory program is already underway in Europe and will be deployed in phases throughout Asia and the Americas this year to reach all PVH associates around the world as part of our overall I&D learning curriculum.

Establish and implement an I&D leadership goal for annual performance review process for people managers globally by 2022. Going forward, all people managers will have a specific I&D objective as part of their annual performance review process. This measure will hold our leaders accountable on actively driving our stated I&D commitments to fairness, equity and inclusion. MARKETPLACE Marketing and Advertising Review: 7. Establish quarterly global review of all company and brand marketing and advertising materials and experiences to ensure diverse representation by 2021. It is important that our stores, showrooms and online venues deliver exceptional experiences that resonate with the unique needs and perspectives of our diverse consumers. To ensure these elements and materials reflect the wide range of consumer diversity, we will establish a cross-brand and business review board and implement a formal quarterly review process of our consumer-facing product, marketing, experiences and touchpoints. Supplier Diversity Program: 8. Establish a formal corporate supplier diversity program in the U.S. and other applicable regions by 2022. At PVH, we have made great strides in advancing human rights across the apparel supply chain, and we seek to extend this work and address issues of equity and inclusion with the indirect procurement of goods and services in the U.S. and other applicable regions. To achieve this, we will establish a formal supplier diversity program to track, monitor and expand our engagement and spend with a focus on minority/BIPOC and women-owned businesses. BRAAVE BUILDING RESOURCES FOR AFRICAN AMERICA BUILDING RESOURCES FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN VOICES AND EMPOWERMENT Guy Vickers, President of the PVH Foundation, stands with associates at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington D.C. COMMUNITY Awareness and Access: 9. Invest $10 million globally over the next four years to amplify awareness and access to opportunities in the fashion industry. A significant barrier to greater inclusion and diversity, particularly in the fashion industry, is that underserved or underrepresented communities lack awareness of, and access to, opportunities in the industry. We aim to leverage the power of PVH and our platform to address those issues by committing a total of $10 million over the next four years to support organizations, programs and initiatives that engage those communities and create greater pathways to opportunities in the fashion industry. "THE INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY CHALLENGES IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY ARE REAL. WE HAVE WORK TO DO AT PVH, AND TOGETHER WITH OUR LARGER INDUSTRY, WE HAVE A COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAN IN AND DRIVE REAL IMPACT. THIS IS AS IMPORTANT AS ANY BUSINESS STRATEGY AND SPEAKS MORE BROADLY TO WHO WE ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS AND THE IMPACT WE CAN HAVE ON SOCIETY." Stefan Larsson, PVH CEO

As part of the three-pronged commitment focused on listening, learning and action, we ran our first-ever global giving campaign supporting non-profit organizations focused on racial justice and equality, and hosted Associate Listening Sessions from August to October 2020 to provide a safe space for Black associates to share their experiences and discuss opportunities for advancement. AMPLIFYING INCLUSIVITY ACROSS THE APPAREL INDUSTRY Alongside our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses, we became a founding signatory of the Black in Fashion Council Pledge to support the advancement of Black individuals in fashion and beauty companies. In line with these efforts, Tommy Hilfiger launched the People's Place Program, a three-pillared platform that will seek to advance the representation of Black, indigenous and people of color within the fashion and creative industries. CULTIVATING GLOBAL INCLUSION & DIVERSITY CONVERSATIONS We relaunched our Inclusion & Diversity "Let's Talk" speaker events globally to give associates access to internal leaders and external speakers discussing integral I&D topics including intersectionality, racial injustice, gender parity and more. These events support our efforts to become a better-educated and progressively unbiased organization. INCREASED REPRESENTATION THROUGH BUSINESS RESOURCE GROUP EXPANSION We expanded our BRGs to create more opportunity for representation at all levels of the organization with new chapters in Asia, Europe and Australia for our LGBTQIA+, women and BIPOC associates and their allies. BRGs are associate-led groups that act as a resource for both the members and the organization by focusing on our global I&D strategic priorities. 35 REINFORCING OUR COMMITMENT TO GENDER EQUALITY WITH UNGC To promote gender parity, we joined the UN Global Compact's Target Gender Equality initiative to advance gender parity across PVH, our branded businesses, and our industry. Additionally, we signed the Paradigm for Parity pledge, joining a coalition of business leaders dedicated to addressing the corporate leadership gender gap. PROGRESS TOWARD GLOBAL UNCONSCIOUS BIAS TRAINING PVH Europe began to roll out mandatory Unconscious Bias training to all PVH Europe associates. From June 2020 to December 2020, more than 1,400 associates were trained, with the goal to have all 11,000 associates trained by Summer 2021. As part of our I&D Commitments, this will be deployed in phases throughout Asia and the Americas in 2021 as part of our overall I&D learning curriculum.

SINCE OUR BASELINE IN 2017, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED SCIENCE-BASED TARGETS THROUGH THE SCIENCE BASED TARGET INITIATIVE (SBTI) IN 2019. THESE INCLUDE: A reduction in absolute Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions by 30% by 2030 Increase annual sourcing of renewable electricity from in 2018 by 2030 22% to 100% 2020 brought forth challenges that put a spotlight on the need for businesses and governments to prioritize climate action and reduce negative environmental impacts. We have always recognized the importance of partnerships in driving lasting change and measurable progress in the fight against climate change. As organizations around the world answer the urgent call for climate action, we are proud to have reaffirmed our environmental commitments, advocated for and piloted solutions through cross-sector collaboration, and continued to actively evolve our business practices to prioritize climate-friendly raw materials and investment in renewable energy. Marking the fifth anniversary of the Paris Climate Agreement, and recognizing the progress made and the work left to be done, we endorsed America Is All In, the most expansive coalition of leaders ever assembled in support of climate action in the United States. Working alongside the federal government, thousands of private and public sector entities mobilized to raise domestic and international climate ambition, working toward a healthy, prosperous, equitable, and sustainable future. We joined our peers in signing the UNGC's "Business Ambition for 1.5ºC Commitment Letter" as well as a Statement from Business Leaders for Renewed Global Cooperation, recognizing the critical need for multilateral partnership in overcoming challenges and finding climate solutions. Published in conjunction with the UNGC, Science-based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and the We Mean Business Coalition (WMB), the statement is the largest-ever, UN-backed, CEO-led climate advocacy effort. By joining the signatory, companies reaffirmed their own science-based commitments to achieving a zero- carbon economy and urged governments across the globe to match their ambition as they finalized stimulus packages to support economic recovery. We supported multiple climate advocacy initiatives calling for climate-smart policies to be prioritized in the development of post-pandemic recovery strategies. We became a signatory of RE100's letter to EU policymakers calling for corporate renewables to be built into the EU's COVID-19 economic stimulus package. Organized by RE100-a global corporate renewable energy initiative of which we've been a member since 2018-signatories called for a policy framework to boost corporate renewable electricity sourcing

READ MORE ADDRESSING WATER SCARCITY WITH UNGC CEO WATER MANDATE'S WATER RESILIENCE COALITION Recognizing the need to accelerate efforts to respond to water scarcity and its impacts, and in continuation of our water stewardship efforts, we joined our peers in the UNGC CEO Water Mandate in founding the Water Resilience Coalition and signing the Water Resiliency Pledge. This commitment focuses on collaborating to advance our shared mission to ensure freshwater basins are able to consistently supply what's needed for communities, businesses and the environmental resources upon which we all depend. The COVID-19 pandemic further emphasized the critical need to ensure access to clean and sustainable water sources for communities. DRIVING SUSTAINABLE PROGRESS THROUGH HIGG FEM DATA In 2020, we conducted an in-depth analysis of data from a total of 428 PVH facilities gathered through the Higg FEM self-assessment and verification tool, gaining insights into the progress our suppliers are making toward meeting our social and environmental standards and expectations. We learned that 65% of our verified facilities have mostly or fully achieved Level 1 across all Higg modules-meaning they are measuring their performance and demonstrating environ- mental compliance. We also identified our wet processing facilities as our largest opportunity for improvement, requiring further engagement and support from our team. These insights are key as we work to promote improved ways of working across the apparel sector and empower our suppliers to reduce environmental impacts across our supply chain. PROTECTING WATER RESOURCES AND PROVIDING FOR WATER-STRESSED COMMUNITIES We are working to reduce the risk of water scarcity in five of our most water-stressed sourcing communities including efforts in Ethiopia's Lake Hawassa, China's Taihu Basin, Vietnam's Mekong Delta, and India's Noyyal Bhavani Basin. Our partners at WWF and GIZ are our central experts in water resiliency and stewardship, helping drive remediation activities to preserve and restore local water resources in our most water-stressed strategic sourcing regions.

REPAIR, DONATE OR RECYCLE WASTE NOTHING, WELCOME ALL. THE JEANS REDESIGN THESE JEANS WERE CREATED USING THE JEANS REDESIGN GUIDELINES, AN INITIATIVE THAT ENSURES WE WORK TOGETHER AS AN INDUSTRY TO CREATE CIRCULAR AND DURABLE DENIM. Our Forward Fashion priority to Innovate for Circularity aims to foster innovation to design and manufacture products that eliminate product waste by being made with safe and renewable materials, made to be made again and traceable back to their sources. We are gathering insights and exploring creative solutions to achieve the goal for three of our most commonly purchased products to be completely circular including full traceability of key raw materials by 2025. Guided through partnerships with experts like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, we are working together to meet the accelerated consumer demand for sustainable, purposeful brands and experiences, and create products in line with our four-pillared definition of circularity, which defines a circular product as one that: · Is designed with safe and renewable materials. · Is made to be made again. · Leverages new business models to extend the life of clothing, and capture rental and resale market share. · Is underpinned by traceability and transparency, which are crucial to unlock circular product and business models at scale. Through our partnerships with Fashion for Good and Plug and Play, we're testing and piloting the scalability of technologies and solutions to make the circular economy a reality for the apparel industry-from the materials we source to the packaging that makes its way to our consumers to how we turn one product into a new product. We joined peer organizations to participate in Fashion for Good's Full Circle Textiles project with a goal to enable the scaling of technology needed to break down old garments and make them new. The project is testing textile-to-textile chemical recycling-the process of recovering fiber, yarn or fabric and reprocessing the material into new yarn to be used in our supply chains, with five innovators including Evrnu, Infinited Fiber Company, PhoenixT, Re:Newcell and Tyton BioSciences. In line with this work, we explored Infinited Fiber Company's innovative technology turning cellulose- rich materials-like pre-worn garments or even used cardboard or straw-into unique, biodegradable, fully circular fibers. Both pilots drive progress toward achieving our Forward Fashion goals and support our organization-wide efforts to incorporate more sustainable materials across our portfolio.

WE'RE IN A CATALYZING MOMENT WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAN IN EVEN MORE ON SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS AND CIRCULARITY." Samantha Sims PVH Vice President, Environmental Sustainability and Product Stewardship 34% Progressing toward a circular economy requires adoption of materials throughout our supply chain that are sustainable, recyclable and made to be made again. Polybags-the packaging used to protect our products during transit-are a sustainability hurdle for companies across our industry. To address this issue, and drive progress toward our Forward Fashion goal to End Waste, we partnered with Fashion for Good to facilitate a collaborative "Circular Polybag" pilot. By testing technology that de-inks and removes adhesives from the polybags, the pilot aimed to recycle collected polybags into polybags made with 80% post-consumer recycled content. Together, our teams produced a polybag that meets our environmental standards and can be scaled for use across our supply chain. (56,764 MT) of total material use was from more sustainable materials Sustainable materials include those with sustainable certifications such as organic and recycled. NA E READ: Relevant Indices Surrounding Waste We look forward to expanding upon these explorations and marking more milestones on our collective journey to a more sustainable future. NA 2021 AND BEYOND Enabling On-Product Transparency to Scale Providing consumers with credible and clear information on the sustainable attributes of our products is key to being transparent and responding to increasing consumer demand for sustainable products. We also believe that information at points of sale must be consistent among brands for it to be digestible and actionable for our consumers. We are partnering with the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) to adapt the Higg Index tools created to measure environmental and social impacts to translate them into an industry-wide on-product label to disclose environmental and social impact data. We're working with each of our marketing teams to test this program across our brand portfolio in 2021, with an aim for adoption and implementation as we work to respond to our consumers' sustainability expectations and explore new ways to communicate this important information. Mapping Chemical Content Within Post-Consumer Recycled Textiles Transitioning to clean and reliable sources of recycled materials supports our Forward Fashion goals to Regenerate Materials and Innovate for Circularity. However, that transition presents several challenges, one of which is the lack of knowledge about the chemical content within post- consumer recycled textiles. To address this, we are participating in a large-scale study led by H&M Group and Inter IKEA Group to understand how post-consumer recycled textiles measure against existing chemical standards. This year, the study group will pool its test results and share its findings, with a goal to develop an evidence-based action plan for the wider industry adoption of recycled textiles that meet strict chemical and safety standards.

With STITCH, designers can digitally construct products, enabling them to design garments that consider more efficient production processes and are prototyped in a matter of hours rather than weeks. EXPLORATIONS DRIVEN BY OUR FIRST-EVER TAKEBACK PILOT PROGRAM We launched our first clothing takeback pilot program in 2019 to test and learn how we can repurpose post-consumer products. Insights from this pilot have informed opportunities for product repair-helping us understand the most common repairs and associated cost considerations-reworking for resale, downcycling and the implementation of innovative technologies for chemical recycling, where garments are broken down into their basic elements and re-spun into recycled fibers, yarns and textiles. We look forward to continuing to partner to identify further unlocks for a circular economy. 41 PRESERVING WATER RESOURCES THROUGH TOMMY HILFIGER'S LOWER IMPACT DENIM PROGRAM Beginning in 2020, Tommy Hilfiger set a target for 50% of its denim pieces to use lower-impact manufacturing in finishes, and has targeted that by 2025 50% of its denim pieces will use lower-impact fabrics. The Lower Impact Denim (LID) program is key in driving this goal, which drives adoption of denim finishes with lower environmental impacts across our supply chain. In 2020, more than 2 million TOMMY HILFIGER denim garments utilized lower-impact finishes.

Due to the pandemic, many women across the value chain were disproportionately affected through impact to pay, increased gender-based violence, lack of childcare and parental support, and for some, dropping out of the workforce entirely. Considering these obstacles, as well as pre-pandemic challenges, our Forward Fashion strategy sets a target to Empower Women by removing barriers to advancement and creating pathways to opportunity and choice for women in our supply chain, with a key target to make professional and life skills development programs and services available to 500,000 women across our supply chain by 2030. We reaffirmed our dedication to this goal in 2020 by pledging our target as a UN Foundation commitment, expanding its scope to include health and other services, and calling on our industry peers to do the same.

HAS PROVIDED ME WITH SKILLS TO GROW, BOTH IN MY CAREER AND AS A PERSON. AS A TEAM LEADER I AM NOW ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY GUIDE MY TEAM TO HIGH PERFORMANCE, USING THE TOOLS, TECHNIQUES AND BEHAVIORS I LEARNED THROUGH P.A.C.E." Lakmali Dilushika Team Leader at PVH supplier MAS Intimates 6,586 women reached through Women's Empowerment pro- gramming The driving force behind this work is the implementation of Gap Inc.'s Personal Advancement Career Enhancement (P. A.C.E.) program, an evidence-based comprehensive learning program for female garment workers that covers topics such as communication, problem solving and decision making, time and stress management, as well as water, sanitation and hygiene, health, and legal and financial literacy. We're committed to enabling women to leverage the knowledge obtained through the P. A.C.E. program to better access healthcare, legal and other essential services to further address their needs outside of the workplace. In 2020 we launched our first-ever P. A.C.E. community program in Ethiopia, benefiting communities near Hawassa Industrial Park. While we have launched P. A.C.E. trainings in 15 factories and facilities around the world, this marks our first program facilitated in a community setting with modules geared more toward life skills and communication tools that participants can take into their home and personal lives. RESILIENCY OF OUR P.A.C.E. VENDORS The benefits of the P. A.C.E. program have been evident since its implementation and, as with many programs and initiatives across our work, the necessity of P. A.C.E. was only amplified by COVID-19. "The pandemic raised many problems that we had to overcome," remarked Dilmi Ekanayake, Senior Executive of Human Resources and P.A.C.E. Gold Trainer at PVH vendor factory Hela Intimates. "It was clear to me that the participants of the P. A.C.E. workshops really wanted to learn what we were teaching, but at the same time we did not want to put their safety at risk." 43 We are also partnering with suppliers to establish structures that encourage vendor program ownership and promote program sustainability through integration into supply chain vendor and factory policies, processes and human resources management systems. As the first apparel company to obtain a license to implement P. A.C.E. in its supply chain, this programming has helped us reach 6,586 women with our Women's Empowerment programming to date across four countries including Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Ethiopia. Our industry has a uniquely human supply chain, and empowering the individuals who help shape our brands is key to furthering Forward Fashion. As a foundation for these efforts, we are committed and aligned to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector, and our current operations are consistent with this Guidance. SUPPLY CHAIN READ: PVH Corporate Responsibility Supply Chain Standards and Guidelines 5 Staff at the Hela facility quickly implemented necessary safety measures-temperature checks, mask mandates, class size limitations-to allow for safe workshop facilitation, with virtual classes held as needed. This is but one example of how our vendors who have continued to facilitate P. A.C.E. programming across our supply chain have ensured that women in the workforce continue to be empowered not only to persevere but to thrive amid unforeseen challenges.

Recognizing that monitoring the recruitment practices and employment conditions of migrant workers can be challenging and involves a long-term ongoing commitment, we continued to evolve our resources and practices to address this issue. Building upon our updated Migrant Worker Policy and enhanced risk assessments, this year our teams launched Recruit Ethically training for all our suppliers in 12 high-risk jurisdictions. The sessions focused on PVH standards and the key elements of our Migrant Worker Policy, including our requirement that no worker pays any recruitment fee. The training also focused on the development of management systems to mitigate risk of forced labor, labor agent due diligence, and remediation processes if fees are found. Issues involving migrant workers and forced labor are complex and can only be addressed through collaboration with our suppliers and other key partners. We continue to prioritize actions and partnerships with organizations like the Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI), reflecting our dedication to scaling cross-industry efforts to address the risk of forced labor in supply chains around the world. PROMOTING EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT WITH SAVE THE CHILDREN The PVH Foundation's long-time partnership with Save the Children works to ensure children have the strong foundation they need to lead healthy, productive lives. In Bangladesh, our Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) project seeks to improve school readiness of garment workers' children by promoting cognitive, physical and social development, along with enhancing caregivers' parenting knowledge. The PVH ECCD project has been implemented in six ready-made garment (RMG) factories and, despite the impacts of COVID-19, we reached 4,892 individuals in 2020, including 2,321 children and 2,571 working parents. INCREASING DISCLOSURE TO ADVANCE LIVING WAGES We are committed to ensuring that workers' compensation meets basic needs and provides some discretionary income and that fair labor practices are upheld throughout our supply chain. In our 2019 report we shared living wage data for the first time, directly comparing workers' average hourly wages in PVH supplier factories to both legal minimum hourly wages and average hourly wages in the apparel sector. This year, we expanded disclosure of wage data by increasing the number of in-scope sourcing countries from six to nine (moving from 75% to 86% of PVH's global FOB*). *PVH defines Freight on Board (FOB) as the total cost of the garments we manufacture in each of our in-scope countries.

The feedback has been instrumental in informing how we will work in the future and, as a result, we implemented a number of programs: · Reimbursement for expenses related to setting up remote workspace. · Continuation of our Flexible Workplace Program, giving associates the option to flex their start and end times up to 90 minutes outside of core hours, as long as business needs are met. · Amendment of our Personal Time Off (PTO) policy in 2020 to carry over 10 days into 2021. · Invested in Microsoft Teams and upgraded our Cisco WebEx and Jabber software to help our corporate associates stay connected and organized while working remotely. PRIORITIZING PAID TIME OFF WITH VOLUNTARY "YOU TIME" AND "BE YOU DAY" We recognize that associates have other responsibilities to consider, especially during this unprecedented time. We launched the Voluntary You Time (VYT) program in our Amsterdam office allowing associates to voluntarily request reduced working hours or take extended time off, in exchange for a pro-rated reduction in salary and benefits. Additionally, we introduced "Be You Day," a personal floating holiday to be used by PVH global associates for unique traditions and days that matter to them throughout the year, be it religious, cultural or personal. ACCELERATED ASSOCIATE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES We accelerated the roll-out of our PVH University platform and nearly tripled the number of associates with access to digital learning and development content. Additionally, we introduced new development programs, including an "Ask Me Anything" series with PVH leadership and a Live Labs program to provide virtual hands-on tips and professional guidance to associates. SUPPORTING WELL-BEING THROUGH #YOUMATTER AND CULTURE OF CARE We are committed to ending the stigma around all health conversations, whether it be mental, social, physical or financial health. To provide support and encourage peer-to-peer listening, we launched the #YOUMATTER community in which trained, volunteer Listeners from across our organization are available to give their undivided attention in a safe and confidential setting.

We established science-based targets through the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) in 2019, which includes a 30% reduction in global supply chain emissions by 2030, from a 2017 baseline. We are working to lower our GHG footprint by cutting energy consumption, increasing energy efficiency and increasing our renewable energy at our facilities and across our supply chain. This commitment extends beyond measuring and reducing energy consumed in our own operations (Scope 1) and purchased electricity (Scope 2) emissions to doing the same with our indirect emissions (Scope 3).

As part of our approach, PVH collects supplier wage data on an ongoing basis during factory assessments. The data is analyzed at the end of each fiscal year to compare average hourly wages paid to workers in PVH supplier factories with legal minimum hourly wages, average hourly wages in the apparel sector and living wage benchmarks. This wage data depicts year-over-year comparisons for FY19 and FY20 and reflects an expanded reporting scope from six to nine countries this year, constituting 86% of PVH's global FOB value in 2020.

Tell PVH creates a direct channel for open and anonymous communication to report concerns about misconduct and violations of our code of conduct and to ensure that concerns are heard and addressed in a timely manner. Since 2017, Tell PVH is open to all workers in our supply chain, in addition to PVH associates. To ensure that our supply chain workers are aware of Tell PVH, auditors hand out information cards to workers during PVH CR assessment. Tell PVH acts as a channel for PVH to capture and address concerns or complaints raised by the people who work for us directly and indirectly in our supply chain. Workers and associates, subject to certain legal limitations, can report any suspected policy violations, inappropriate behavior and unethical practices via the hotline. In the majority of cases, they can make reports anonymously, either online or by telephone, in one of 15 languages. We provide regular updates to the associate or worker concerned, who can also track the progress of the complaint online. When we receive a worker grievance, either from the worker directly or via a union or NGO, CR associates document the issue and escalate it immediately to our CR leadership via a weekly reporting and escalation process that is documented through a standard operating procedure, from factory notification through executive review. The corporate and regional CR teams coordinate to address the issue by engaging the worker, factory managers, the relevant PVH sourcing team and potentially third parties. The CR team verifies the validity of the claim, arranges appropriate investigations and works with relevant parties to address any gaps. All parties are kept informed of developments. The CR team looks for trends or similarities to other findings in comparable factories, and incorporates such learnings in remediation activities. In FY20, PVH received 14 grievance cases, 6 from workers (3 from Tell PVH, 3 from other channels) and 8 cases from trade unions. Investigations of 3 cases are still ongoing, all the rest of 11 cases are addressed.

Our mid-2020 install of solar panels in our Venlo distribution center will show an increase in measurable benefits for the 2021 reporting year .* · Continued to collaborate with our industry peers to reduce Scope 3 emissions across our supply chain, through our involvement in the Fashion Pact, UN Fashion Charter, and investments in mill improvement programs through the Sustainable Apparel Coalition's (SAC) Apparel Impact Institute (Aii). · Driven by data gathered through Higg Facility Environmental Module (FEM), we've continued to explore innovations and technology solutions to improve processes across our supply chain. We learned that 35 of our facilities account for 75% of overall energy consumption and 70% of overall GHG emissions-with 6% still using coal in their operations.

We also committed to ending our use of single-use plastics through the Fashion Pact. · We're continually assessing the environmental demands of our on-product packaging across all PVH businesses and exploring alternatives and technological innovations as solutions are introduced to the market. · Made a formal commitment to Canopy's CanopyStyle and Pack4Good initiatives, which address both our wood-based materials in the supply chain and paper and packaging use, with an added focus on materials that can negatively contribute to the clearing of forests throughout our value chain. It includes a commitment to eliminate Ancient and Endangered Forests fiber from our viscose fabrics by the end of 2021. |
|  | ELIMINATE HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS & MICROFIBERS Eliminate water pollution from our wet processors, recognizing that water is essential to the livelihoods and sanitation needs of those in the communities in which we work and live. | Water leaving our wet processors will have zero hazardous chemicals and be filtered for harmful microfibers. | 2025 | · Commit to using safer substances in the materials and processes required to manufacture our products and protect our consumers, workers, sourcing communities and the natural environment. · Utilize standardized industry tools to contribute to enabling efficient removal of hazardous chemicals from our supply chain. · Drive effective chemical management practices across the product life cycle: managing inputs and outputs, and innovating chemistries.      | · 56% of our wet processing facilities that have submitted verified Higg FEM data (in 2019) have fully achieved a Level 2 score in the wastewater module, demonstrating that they are tracking the quality of their wastewater allowing them to set clear improvement targets in order to report against industry wastewater standards. . Among our wet processing suppliers that submit verified Higg FEM data, 93% have fully achieved the requirements of the water module. They have established a water usage baseline, are tracking their ongoing water use, and they are setting targets to manage and improve water usage based on industry standards. · Only 27% of facilities 'fully' or 'mostly' achieved a Level 2 score in the chemicals module. We are using this data to inform program recommendations to drive further progress in our supplier facilities, including a 2021 focus on chemical inventories.                                                                                                                  |

| INNOVATE FOR CIRCULARITY Foster and harness innovation to design and manufacture products that eliminate product and production waste. | Three of our most commonly purchased products will be completely circular, including the full traceability of key raw materials. | 2025 | · Work toward circularity based on a four-part definition informed by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation: - Design products with safe and renewable materials; - Make products that are "made to be made again"; - Use new business models to extend the use of clothing, and capture rental and resale market share; - Implement traceability mechanisms and systems. · Instill a circular mindset across PVH in product design, development and (re)distribution through guidelines, training, measurement tools and systems integration. · By incentivizing and collaborating with supply chain partners, innovators and other actors- and leveraging precompetitive cross-industry collaboration where possible-we're testing, investing in and applying new technologies, materials and business models to enable circularity across our value chain. This is supported by our digital acceleration efforts which enable more efficient design production and traceability, critical to producing circular products. | · Helped drive Fashion for Good's Full Circle Textiles project to explore the scaling of textile-to-textile chemical recycling technology to break down old garments and make them new. · Partnered with Fashion for Good for a pilot to recycle collected polybags into polybags made with 80% post-consumer recycled content. · Worked across our brand portfolio to create circular product road maps with complementary trainings. · Tommy Hilfiger launched the first circular business model across our brand portfolio, Tommy for Life, in The Netherlands. The model takes back items from consumers as well as damaged pieces from our stores or online operations, then cleans, repairs and resells them, keeping products in use longer. Through Tommy for Life, we've diverted 36,429 kg of textile waste in The Netherlands to date. An expansion of the program is planned for 2021, with learnings from the program informing the development of circular business models across our organization. · Released updated Global Sustainable Materials and Packaging guidelines and facilitated an accompanying webinar to further educate more than 200 associates in eight regions and office locations. · We continue to drive change through circular innovation, as demonstrated by Tommy Hilfiger and Ellen MacArthur Foundation's (EMF) Jeans Redesign Collection, created with circular design principles like detachable buttons and the replacement of metal rivets. |

This year we expanded our policy to include a PVH-wide commitment to sourcing 100% sustainable wool by 2025 procured through the Responsible Wool Standard and certified recycled wool. We will continue evolving our policies and exploring alternative materials as new standards and innovations are introduced to the market.                                                                                   | As we drive progress toward our Forward Fashion goal for all PVH offices, warehouses and stores to be powered by 100% renewable electricity by 2030, we're exploring opportunities for more on-site renewable energy generation at our global distribution centers and pursuing solutions for offsite renewable energy such as virtual power purchase agreements. We're continuing to deploy energy efficiency programs, including the rollout of LED retrofits in our North American retail locations, and are implementing a third-party software solution to streamline and improve how we monitor energy usage throughout our North American owned and operated facilities. |

Spend Visibility allows procurement to analyze and measure indirect spend (non-merchandise, non-resale)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 103-2 The management approach and its components                                     | data and metrics by vendor, commodity, and diverse supplier. Within this RFP tool, Dunn & Bradstreet's diversity tool was implemented to track our diverse suppliers that participate in our competitive bidding process. Through this tool, data is available on awarded suppliers based on the capability that allows vendors the opportunity to self-identify as minority registered businesses. Diverse Spend is represented using categories per Dunn & Bradstreet classifications. Vendors may represent and report under multiple diverse categories such as Disabled Owned, HBCU, Minority Owned, Small Business, Veteran Owned, Woman Owned, Disabled Veteran Owned. One of our I&D Commitments is to establish a formal corporate supplier diversity program in the U.S. and other applicable regions by 2022. We seek to address issues of equity and inclusion with the indirect procurement of goods and services in the U.S. and other applicable regions by establishing a formal supplier diversity program to track, monitor and expand our engagement and spend with a focus on minority/BIPOC- and women-owned businesse. All procurement associates are also required to include minority vendors as part of their search criteria throughout the vetting process when expanding our supply-base for upcoming projects and/or existing programs. Procurement has also successfully mandated the requirement for PVH teams to include Procurement on specific projects that fall within a specific spend-threshold. By accomplishing this, Procurement can take the lead on assisting with bringing new potential minority businesses to fruition. Procurement's strategic goal is to manage all indirect spend in order to provide more opportunity specifically for more diverse suppliers. In the future, we aim to establish/implement a formalized supplier diversity program. |

| 103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary                       | We understand the importance of implementing strong policies and procedures around bribery and anti-corruption. We have systems in place to train associates on ways to identify and report potential cases of bribery and/or corruption. Legal and Compliance personnel also conduct ongoing risk assessments. We strive to ensure that all of our policies and procedures reflect our commitment to upholding the highest moral, ethical and legal standards in everything we do. In order to help our associates understand our policies and procedures, we require mandatory in-person and online compliance training, in local languages. To measure effectiveness, internal and external auditors conduct periodic reviews of our anti-corruption program at the global, regional, country and business unit levels. Our policy development and distribution, training and assessments are reported to our key stakeholders. We engage senior management, Legal, Audit, HR, Corporate Responsibility and key business leaders in every geography in which we do business to assist with the dissemination and socialization of our program, policies and procedures. |

| 103-2 The management approach and its components         | Considering the volumes of various raw material types, as well as business risks and opportunities, we identified priority areas of focus within natural, synthetic and animal-based raw material categories. To implement this strategy, we are introducing new resources, tools and trainings to our raw materials and design teams to enable them to incorporate sustainability considerations into their daily activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach              | Sourcing cotton more sustainably for the environment and farming communities is a particular global focus for us. Cotton represents 70% of our raw material use, so we have a great need and opportunity to invest in sourcing more sustainable cotton. We are taking a portfolio approach to sustainable cotton by procuring and supporting the market growth for a variety of more sustainable cotton sources, including Better Cotton, organic cotton, and recycled cotton. As our program continues to evolve, we are continuously addressing the need to move further into our materials supply chain due to the high level of impact at the growing/milling stage. A core component of our global sustainable cotton program is sourcing Better Cotton, which is produced by farmers in a way that is measurably better for the environment and farming communities. |
|                                                          | In terms of synthetic fibers, several of our divisions are taking a lead on initiating the procurement of recycled or upcycled fibers with a view to scale these efforts, where appropriate. We are continuously identifying opportunities for all our divisions to feature products made with recycled polyester, with the aim of eventually sourcing recycled polyester whenever possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary         | Water is used at every stage of our product lifecycles-from growing raw materials (such as cotton) to dyeing, tanning, printing and finishing garments, to the way consumers launder clothes. We have used a number of different resources, insights and tools to develop a comprehensive global water strategy. The strategy is informed by our UN CEO Water Mandate commitment, a global water risk analysis conducted by WWF and insights into the lifecycle impacts of our products. Additionally, we have been leveraging the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) Programme's work, notably its Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) and Wastewater Guidelines. We have also taken steps to gain greater insight into our Level 1 and 2 suppliers' water use, particularly through the SAC's Higg Index Facilities Environmental Module (FEM). PVH initiated a water risk assessment that accounted for approximately 90% of all Level 1 suppliers and strategic Level 2 suppliers. PVH collected the location of suppliers uploaded onto the WWF-DEG Water Risk Filter. Using the criteria provided by the Water Risk Filter, determinations were made on each facility's water risk based on calculations of physical, regulatory and reputational risk.

| 303-1 Interactions with water as a shared source | PVH primarily uses municipal water in our worldwide stores, offices, warehouses, distribution centers, neckwear factory and our joint venture in Hawassa, Ethiopia. The functions of these facilities are not water-intensive as use is limited to cleaning, maintenance activities, and personal consumption by employees, in comparison to other stages across the value chain. Freshwater availability is vital to PVH because it is critical for the growth of cotton and production of other raw material inputs in the value chain. It is also vital for the wet processing portion of the value chain (e.g., dyeing, washing, finishing) of a garment. Additionally, freshwater is essential for the health and hygiene of communities in which we operate. Through our roll-out of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition's Higg Facility Environmental Module from 2017-2019, we collected data to better understand our suppliers' environmental performance with a goal of driving improvements by setting targets. |
|                                                  | We ask all our Level 1 (cut and sew/ready-made goods) and strategic Level 2 suppliers (fabric mills, spinners, and dye houses) to report on water use, risks, and management practices by responding to the Higg Index. By engaging with our most strategic suppliers, representing over 80% of our business, we are able to calculate our water baseline by geography, facility type, and category, and understand our progress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|                                                  | Much of the apparel industry's water impact occurs early in the supply chain, particularly when fabrics are dyed or at wet processing facilities. PVH has continued to expand our assessment program to gain a broader view of our suppliers' water practices by growing our assessment program to include trim and mill facilities. The Higg FEM collects information pertaining to water usage, wastewater volumes and treatment, and water reduction strategies. Success is measured through Higg FEM scores, as it provides comprehensive data that gives insight to both the facility and PVH, to make strategic operational decisions, as well as help devise strategies and remediation plans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                                                  | To work toward our commitments to water stewardship, we identified strategic sourcing regions-China, Ethiopia, India and Vietnam-that were also deemed as high water risk based on the WWF Water Risk Filter. These regions represent approximately half of total spend. Through these programs, we have engaged approximately 150 facilities across more than 50 industrial parks on supplier education and water stewardship collaboration. Our impact promotes a supply chain with access to resources and tools to implement positive change and drive the industry forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

PVH suppliers are obligated to follow all legal requirements for wastewater generated and disposed. In particular, suppliers should maintain valid wastewater and waste disposal permits to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. To manage wastewater in a way that will remove hazardous chemicals from the supply chain, we encourage suppliers to go beyond legal requirements, for example, application of the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines and more advanced wastewater treatment technologies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Specifically, PVH, Tommy Hilfiger, and WWF are working together to help conserve freshwater resources in India's Cauvery River basins, Ethiopia's Lake Hawassa, China's Taihu basin and the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. · Through our collective action basin work, PVH has implemented a number of projects aimed at restoring the local biodiversity. Some specific examples of restoration activities at the basin level include: Through our Protecting Lake Hawassa Initiative we are working to ensure access to clean water for local communities in key basins around the world. Alongside our key partners and technical advisors, GIZ, WWF and the Rift Valley Lakes Basin Development Office, we continue to advance water conservation and stewardship efforts in Ethiopia and other critical water sources for our sourcing communities through exploration of new technologies and educational programming, and support of sustainable development policies at the local and national levels. Some of our commitments focus on removing deforestation and forest degradation from our direct operations and can be seen through our work with the Fashion Pact, Canopy's Pack4Good Initiative, and the We Mean Business Coalition.

From 2018 to 2019, Scope 1 emissions decreased mostly due to the closing of a number of facilities. From 2019 to 2020, Scope 1 emissions decreased by 14%, due mostly to a reduced number of facilities, and facility closures due to COVID-19 iii. Our 2017 baseline uses the market-based approach so that we can account for renewable energy purchases and generation. e.

| 103-2 The management approach and its components 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach | Chemicals are used throughout the apparel manufacturing process. Managing these chemicals effectively and identifying safer substances is central to protecting human health and the environment. We are committed to using safer substances in materials used to manufacture our products and within the manufacturing processes themselves to protect the consumer, workers, sourcing communities, and the natural environment. We also address chemicals in the manufacturing process through the required adoption of the ZDHC Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) and encouraged adoption of the Wastewater Guidelines. To monitor compliance with our chemical management program, we take a risk-based approach to auditing suppliers and testing products. We focus our efforts on the parts of our supply chain where the most significant chemical impacts occur, such as our mills and facilities with wet processing. As such, we require these suppliers to complete the Sustainable Apparel Coalition's Higg Index FEM, as well as achieve minimum scores in the chemical and wastewater modules. In order to drive facility-level improvements and compliance, we expanded our Corporate Responsibility assessment program in 2017 to include a more comprehensive set of chemical indicators, including wastewater testing, in line with Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemical (ZDHC) requirements. This information was collected as part of our roll-out of the Higg FEM. This has allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of chemical performance and compliance at the facility level and to identify areas for improvement. In 2019, 189 wet processors including 44 strategic mills provide us with verified SAC Higg 3.0 FEM data. |

| 103-3 Evaluation of the management approach                                | Suppliers are contractually obligated to uphold our Code of Conduct and perform against our expectations set out in our Supplier Guidelines. As part of our approach, suppliers within our current scope, including strategic and core cut and sew facilities, key mills, trims and wet processors, are assessed annually using Higg FEM to understand environmental impacts. This scope was defined as these operations represent our largest opportunity for impact. After FEM verification, suppliers are required to complete action plans to ensure improvements are being made. Regional advisors engage with facilities regularly throughout the year to track progress against those plans and advise on challenges a facility is facing. Factory authorization is dependent upon performance against supplier guidelines and PVH reserves the right to exit a factory in accordance with PVH Responsible Exit Standard Operation Procedure when necessary. |

| 103-2 The management approach and its components                           | We include environmental criteria in full (long form) supplier assessments (applying to approximately two-thirds of new suppliers). The Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) Higg 3.0 Facility Environmental (FEM) is a standardized tool for measuring apparel suppliers' environmental impacts and helping them drive improvements across seven impact areas. The tool enables us to manage the environmental impacts in our supply chain more effectively and improve the quality of our reporting. As of 2020, 588 total facilities provided SAC Higg FEM data. Virtually all of these facilities have completed the data gathering process and approximately 82% had this data verified. In 2020, we anticipate that approximately 481 facilities in the PVH supply chain, including approximately 189 that involve wet processors (e.g., mills, laundries and dyehouses), will provide verified Higg FEM along with our core CR assessment.                    |

| 401-2 Benefits provided to full-time employees that are not provided to temporary or part-time employees | We are committed to providing our most important asset-our approximately 33,000 associates around the globe-with a great place to work and the opportunities to develop personally and professionally. In addition, we offer competitive pay and benefits, tailoring our offerings to the countries and regions where we work. In 2020, a significant number of benefits were added in support of our associates and their families. We implemented an Employee Assistance Program globally at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1st, 2020) and plan to continue offering it to associates and their families in support of emotional wellbeing. We paid the full cost of healthcare coverage for associates in the Americas for up to 5 months during 2020 to ensure there were no barriers to healthcare. We added a Benefits Resource page to the portal and a weekly Benefits Newsletter to help associates find the programs necessary to support their needs. A COVID-19 HR Support Desk was established to help associates who prefer talking to a representative. We added a Retail job resource site to help associates displaced as a result of COVID-19. Classes were added to PVH U about the CARES Act, unemployment and how to navigate home schooling. Guides on these topics were also added to the portal. Associates were reminded of the Associate Relief Fund to ensure those in need understood how to apply for assistance. The Headspace mindfulness app was added for all associates globally as another tool to help associates find balance. There were benefits that were reworked as well. We added virtual classes to the gym reimbursement programs and provided virtual access to the People's Place Program gym classes in the Netherlands. Weight Watchers program reimbursement was updated to include virtual attendance and more. At the same time, we made other changes to programs but did not cut benefits. The tuition reimbursement program was put on hold and has resumed with a new outsourced vendor who offers discounts to 2,000+ colleges/universities and assistance with financing. The college scholarship program was also put on hold and has resumed with new streamlined, automated administration. Specific benefits vary by associate grade, type of facility, and region and may include: · PVH Wellness Program · Health, dental, and vision insurance · Life and Accidental Death & Dismemberment insurance · Critical Illness, Accident and Hospital Indemnity Insurance Programs . Disability insurance · Retirement plan benefits (401(k) and pension) are available to part-time employees meeting minimum IRS hours requirements · Domestic partner benefits · Global Employee Assistance Program EAP) · Equity Program · Flexible Spending and Health Savings Accounts · Financial wellness/planning and pre-retirement workshops · Flexible working arrangements · Paid time off · Paid parental leave benefits · Identity Theft Protection · Group Legal .

| 103-1 Explanation of the material topic and its Boundary | We work to provide our associates with safe working environments, as well as initiatives and benefits that promote health and wellbeing and foster a positive work-life balance. In our warehouses and distribution centers, our management approach involves providing site and division safety leadership,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 103-2 The management approach and its components         | ensuring facility and division compliance with corporate safety standards, implementing safety directives, continuously improving safety performance, and ensuring safety policies and procedures are aligned with governmental regulations. Retail store operations regularly walk the stores for risk identification and potential hazards. To measure effectiveness, we perform safety audits and inspect facilities, machinery, and safety equipment to identify and correct potential hazards, and to ensure safety regulation compliance. We also conduct ergonomic evaluations of job functions and provide recommendations on methods and techniques. We investigate industrial accidents, near-miss incidents, and occupational injuries to determine causes, install preventive measures, and manage return-to-work activities. We set internal targets and objectives in relation to the above management approach. We also provide for the safety of associates through a business continuity program, which involves associate preparedness, local site preparations, crisis management, and business recovery.

We also conduct regular audits once production begins, work closely with factories to remediate any identified deficiencies and, when necessary, terminate supplier factories that fail to comply with our policies, procedures or guidelines. If a supplier is given a "Red" or "White" rating, this supplier is not approved for production. Following initial assessments, we re-assess suppliers based on the previous rating, participation in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Supplier ratings inform purchasing decisions and training initiatives. We confer with specific sourcing divisions to determine how particular suppliers might be incentivized to raise their performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Prior to exiting a factory, CR confers with specific sourcing divisions to confirm whether PVH is exiting for business reasons or compliance considerations and ensure that measures were taken to address the reasons for exiting. If the supplier is unable to demonstrate sufficient improvement, we ensure that the intention to exit is clearly communicated by PVH to the supplier and work with the supplier to conduct an impact assessment and mitigate adverse impacts on workers. In 2020, we continued the expansion of our assessment program beyond finished goods suppliers to trim facilities and mills, laundries, and other wet processors. |

| B2 Determination of salient issues: Describe how the salient human rights issues were determined, including any input from stakeholders.                               | In late 2020, as part of our effort to achieve PVH's Recruit Ethically Forward Fashion target to ensure that 100% of migrant workers in our Level 1 and key Level 2 facilities do not pay recruitment fees, PVH launched a training to all of our suppliers in our 12 high-risk jurisdictions: Thailand, Taiwan, Jordan, Egypt, Mauritius, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Italy, Bahrain, South Korea, and Japan. These countries were determined to be high risk based on several indicators, including but not limited to public indices on forced labor, presence of migrant workers, and the assessment of internal supply chain data. |
