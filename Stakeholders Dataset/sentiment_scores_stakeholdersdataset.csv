For several weeks, these associates cooked and served over 84,000 hot meals. Løg Walmart driver Greg Carter, who is based in Indiana, traveled to Florida to work at the Mobile Relief Kitchen with his fellow associates. To him, stepping up to help is simply part of the job. ""Everything about Walmart is to take care of the customer,"" Carter said. ""This is just one of the facets that we have. Walmart fills the needs of communities - not only when times are good, but especially when times are bad."" Overall, Walmart, Sam's Club, and the Walmart Foundation donated over $6 million in grants and supplies that helped nonprofits feed and shelter people, clean up debris, and provide relief to underserved communities.

Walmart's Information Security team helps to build and maintain the trust of our customers, associates, and stakeholders by securing our operating environment. Our team analyzes more than seven trillion alerts annually. To help manage the volume of threats, we are prioritizing automation, including by deploying leading third-party tools, supplementing them with our own purpose-built tools, and leveraging internal and external experts to enhance our automated threat management capabilities. One alert that has become more prevalent - especially around the holidays - are retail bots, which are automated programs that purchase inventory online. As more holiday commerce volume has shifted online, we worked to eliminate these bots via automated, purpose-built capabilities that only allow legitimate customers to purchase products.

"FY2023 ESG Highlights Walmart Introduction Opportunity About Our Reporting Sustainability Community Ethics & Integrity 39 Walmart has reported on a wide range of ESG issues since 2005. Our reporting is focused on our priority ESG issues - those that we believe are the most relevant to our business and important to our stakeholders. Each priority issue is covered in-depth in our ESG Issue Briefs. The briefs cover our aspirations and strategies with respect to that issue, the relevance of the issue to business and society, our key goals and metrics, and our progress to date. These briefs will be updated from time to time and may not align with fiscal year reporting periods. These ESG Highlights provide an overview of our shared value approach to ESG, our ESG priorities, and key highlights from the year, but it is not intended to be comprehensive. This report covers activities during the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023 (FY2023), except as otherwise noted. Calendar years (CY) are marked as such or written in a four-digit format. As we highlight each issue in this report, we provide links to the relevant issue brief or briefs. New this year, we are sharing our key ESG metrics as a downloadable spreadsheet to make it easier for our stakeholders to get the information they need. This spreadsheet will be updated from time to time as new information becomes available. We sought and received external assurance from a third party with respect to certain emissions-related information. We did not seek or receive external assurance from third parties with respect to other information, although in certain instances third parties assisted in the process of collecting, analyzing, and calculating information. Our reporting is guided by widely used voluntary reporting frameworks, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the United Nations (U.N.) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We also report through programs such as CDP, a global environmental disclosure system. Please see our GRI, SASB, TCFD, and UN SDGs tables for more information.

"FY2023 ESG Highlights Walmart Endnotes 1 Average total compensation includes average hourly pay, other compensation, and benefits per hour for full- and part-time associates. This does not include special cash bonuses or paid leave related to COVID-19. 2 The calculation excludes the following associate types: Home Office, pharmacists, on-site-clinics, drivers, management trainees, and temporary associates. 3 Data for promotions includes both hourly and management promotions and excludes Walmart Home Office promotions. 4 Calculation is for associates working in stores, clubs, and supply chain. 5 A diverse supplier is defined as a U.S. privately held company that is recognized as at least 51% owned and operated by a woman, minority, veteran, disabled veteran, a person with a disability, or a member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ+) community. All references to ""diverse suppliers"" in this report follow this definition. 6 Calculation is for associates working in stores, clubs, and supply chain. 7 Data for promotions includes both hourly and management promotinos and excludes Walmart Home Office promotions. 8 Wage metrics in the table exclude the following associate types: Home Office associates, pharmacists, on-site-clinics, drivers, management trainees, and temporary associates. 9 The average hourly starting rate is calculated as the average hourly wage of U.S. associates that joined in the preceding six months. Starting wage ranges were $12-$32/hour (Walmart U.S.), $15-$32/hour (Sam's Club U.S.), and $16-$30 (supply chain). The minimum starting wage rate was increased to $14/hour in Walmart U.S. in February 2023. 10 Average total compensation includes average hourly pay, other compensation, and benefits per hour for full-and part-time associates. This does not include special cash bonuses or paid leave related to COVID-19. 11 This segment includes Walmart U.S. stores and supply chain. 12 This segment includes Sam's Clubs and supply chain. 13 Supply chain includes associates who work in distribution and fulfillment centers but excludes drivers. 14 U.S. metrics include all 50 states but exclude Puerto Rico. U.S. non-management metrics include all hourly associates, excluding temporary associates. U.S. management metrics include all salaried, exempt associates. U.S. officer metrics include president, executive vice president, senior vice president, and vice Introduction Opportunity president positions. Data for the U.S. is as of January 31. 15 As reported by grantee organizations. Farmers may benefit from more than one investment or program. Each engagement will be included in calculating total reach. 16 Calculated in accordance with Walmart's Project Gigaton Accounting Methodology, available on the Walmart Sustainability Hub. Suppliers submit information during a Project Gigaton reporting season; figures reported are for the reporting season that took place during the corresponding fiscal year. Because Walmart does not restrict suppliers to reporting only on emissions avoidance and reduction efforts that are attributable to the suppliers' business with Walmart, actions taken and reported through Project Gigaton cannot be used to measure Walmart's Scope 3 emissions, either absolutely or in year-over-year reductions. 17 Annual Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions are updated from time to time for changes in emission factors or activity data when more accurate information become available. This may result in updated emissions reported in the ESG Climate Change brief that may not correspond to results reported to CDP for our annual Climate Change questionnaire. Flipkart emissions data is excluded from Walmart's Scope 1 and 2 emissions footprint and progress calculation. We believe excluding Flipkart's data will have negligible impact on the overall reporting. We engage Lucideon CICS to independently verify Walmart's reported Scope 1 and 2 emissions as reported to CDP annually, pursuant to ISO 14064-3 (the international standard for verification of Greenhouse Gas inventories). We follow Walmart's Greenhouse Gas Inventory Methodology in calculating our GHG emissions, which is consistent with the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative (""The GHG Protocol"") for corporate GHG accounting and reporting. Scope 2 (market-based) emissions include the carbon reduction value of renewable electricity procured from onsite and offsite projects. To account for structural changes in our business, we strive to adjust our emission reduction progress on Scope 1 and 2 emissions to add or subtract emissions for entities acquired or divested in the year the acquisition or divestiture took place, including adjusting for previous years (including the baseline year). 18 For the time frame of the private brands packaging survey, we instructed suppliers to use their latest or most recent 12-month period for which they have data available. If they reported last year, use the same reporting period as the initial/prior reporting year to avoid gaps or overlap with the prior year's submissions. For suppliers that did not complete the survey or provided unusable data, proxy data was substituted to provide a full estimate of global private brand packaging. For the proxy calculation, a market level approach was used. 19 Includes Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club U.S. fresh and frozen, wild-caught and farmed seafood.

Publicly registered FIPs include FIPs and Pre- FIPs, both of which are registered with Fishsource. 20 Includes Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club U.S. bananas. Results do not include volume from spot buys. Spot buy bananas may not qualify as certified ""more sustainable."" Walmart defines ""more sustainable"" bananas as bananas that are certified by Rainforest Alliance, Sustainably Grown, or Fair Trade. 21 Includes Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club U.S. combined coffee.

Third-party-verified energy consumption data is one year in arrears for the CY2019 and CY2020 years. For CY2021, the latest energy consumption data was used. This was used in combination with the electricity procured from our renewable energy projects and the most recent grid fuel mix information obtained from the International Energy Agency for the regions where we operate.

"Walmart FY2023 ESG Highlights 25 The U.S. product net sales figure used for the calculation includes Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club product net sales for the previous four quarters (Q3 through Q2) prior to the start of the survey reporting window.

Flipkart emissions data is excluded from Walmart's Scope 1 and 2 emissions footprint and progress calculation. We believe excluding Flipkart's data will have a negligible impact on the overall reporting. Our emissions footprint in CO2e is calculated to include emissions for our operations for the period in which we owned the operations in the reporting year.

We engage Lucideon CICS to independently verify Walmart's reported Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions as reported to CDP annually, pursuant to ISO 14064-3 (the international standard for verification of Greenhouse Gas inventories). We follow Walmart's Greenhouse Gas Inventory Methodology in calculating our GHG emissions, which is consistent with the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative (""The GHG Protocol"") for corporate GHG accounting and reporting. The GHG Protocol outlines three emissions sources (referred to as ""scopes"") that provide the framework for operational boundaries. The three scopes are: Scope 1, ""Direct Emissions,"" represent emissions from the combustible fuels and other sources that occur directly on sites (e.g., refrigerants,) and mobile emissions sources. Scope 2, ""Indirect Emissions,"" represent emissions that occur off-site to produce electricity or steam purchased for use at corporate locations. Scope 3, ""Other Indirect Emissions,"" represents emissions from activities down or upstream from a company's core business such as product use, waste disposal, commuting, and business travel. Scope 2 (market-based) emissions include the carbon reduction value of renewable electricity procured from onsite and offsite projects. To account for structural changes in our business, we strive to adjust our emission reduction progress on Scope 1 and 2 emissions to add or subtract emissions for entities acquired or divested in the year the acquisition or divestiture took place, including adjusting for previous years (including the baseline year). 28 Calculated in accordance with Walmart's Project Gigaton Accounting Methodology, available on Introduction Opportunity the Walmart Sustainability Hub.

In cases where certified or otherwise documented weights were not available due to industry challenges, they have been estimated based on waste audits, historical data, extrapolation for similar facilities in size and scope, etc. Walmart's operational food waste reduction goal is aligned with Target 12.3 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Progress towards food loss and waste reduction goal measured in conformance with the Food Loss and Waste Protocol's Food Loss and Waste Accounting Standard (FLW Standard) for quantifying food and/or associated inedible parts removed from the food supply chain. This figure is based on review of material handling and waste diversion processes, as reported by waste vendors, food banks and stores. In cases where certified or otherwise documented weights were not available due to industry challenges, they have been estimated based on waste audits, historical data, extrapolation for similar facilities in size and scope, etc. The 2016 baseline was adjusted to remove markets (Argentina, Japan, U.K.) that have since been divested; reported reduction is as against this adjusted baseline. 31 For the time frame of the private brands packaging survey, we instructed suppliers to use their latest or most recent 12-month period for which they have data available. If they reported last year, use the same reporting period as the initial/prior reporting year to avoid gaps or overlap with the prior year's submissions.

Direct suppliers represent 90% of Walmart U.S. net sales of the relevant department, and 89% of the Sam's Club U.S. net sales of the relevant department. The U.S. product net sales figure used for the calculation includes Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club product net sales for the previous four quarters (Q3 through Q2) prior to the start of the survey reporting window. The percentage represents U.S. product net sales of suppliers that reported to Ethical Charter in the reporting year versus all U.S. product net sales.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG DATA CEO INTRODUCTION M&S has created competitive advantage by offering exceptional quality products at remarkable value; products that are made and sourced with care so that they're simply too good to go to waste."" Stuart Machin Chief Executive Officer Sustainability is part of how we do business at M&S - it's in our DNA. From the beginning, M&S has built trust by doing the right thing by our people and the communities we serve, and this remains one of the core values we live by today. When our colleagues, customers, partners or suppliers are in need, we're there to help. For example, when the devastating earthquake hit our franchise partners and sourcing colleagues in Turkey, as well as Syria, earlier this year, we quickly mobilised funding to the British Red Cross appeal and sent practical product donations Read more on page 50. The unique relationship of trust between M&S and its customers runs much deeper than our community impact - it runs right through our entire value chain. Since I joined the business, I've talked about protecting the magic of M&S and for me that magic is summed up in the trusted value promise we make to our customers. Our founders knew that value means much more than price; it means giving customers assurance that raw materials are sourced responsibly to protect the planet for tomorrow, providing confidence that the people who make and sell our products are treated fairly, and it means setting the standards that others follow, whether that's animal welfare or product traceability. In building our business in this way, M&S has created competitive advantage by offering exceptional quality products at remarkable value; products that are made and sourced with care so that they're simply too good to go to waste. It's why we sell more RSPCA Assured products and contribute more Fairtrade premium for tea and coffee than any other retailer and why, since 2019, we have responsibly sourced 100% of the cotton in our clothing through the Better Cotton or with organic and recycled certifications. It's also the reason that ""Exceptional Product and Trusted Brand"" is at the heart of our strategic priorities to reshape M&S. Over the years, this approach to doing business has been increasingly codified into what became one of the first fully integrated sustainability programmes, launched in 2007 as Plan A. Today, Plan A is not a separate programme but rather sits within the business, with accountability for its delivery devolved to each of the Managing Directors. While our approach to sustainability starts with our Exceptional Product and Trusted Brand, it runs through all our strategic priorities to provide the foundation for our plans to reshape M&S for growth that is sustainable in every sense. HOW AND WHERE WE OPERATE M&S operates as a family of businesses across Food, Clothing & Home, Property, International and Services. M&S Est. 1884 139 Year heritage 30m+ Customers served each year 1,064 UK owned and franchise stores selling innovative and exclusive product 100 + International markets as part of our growing global presence 64,000 Remarkable people, who all have a role in delivering change and great service at M&S Marks and Spencer Group plc Sustainability Report 2023 3",0.2809171888717343
"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG DATA CEO INTRODUCTION CONTINUED RESHAPING M&S: OUR PROGRESS THIS YEAR Our Exceptional Product and Trusted Brand are core to what makes us M&S. We continue to lead the market on quality standards and perception, as customers trust us to deliver great value food that doesn't compromise on sourcing standards and everyday style that is made well and made to last. This year we raised the bar again by becoming the first retailer to only sell slower-reared, higher-welfare chicken across our fresh products - a move welcomed by RSPCA Assured as the biggest positive change to chicken farming in a generation. In Clothing we stepped up our sourcing due diligence, with the introduction of new technologies that can trace our cotton right back to its region and farm of origin - giving us and our customers increased confidence in our Responsible Cotton Sourcing Policy Read more on page 22. Of course, making our products is a major contributor to our carbon footprint. However, as an own-brand retailer, we are uniquely positioned to innovate in partnership with our longstanding supplier partners to reduce emissions. This year we've made strong progress, particularly in Food, where we have fully aligned our top supplier strategy to our net zero target Read more on page 24 and in Clothing, we have built capability to deliver net zero as a key consideration in developing our new sourcing strategy. True leadership in Omni-channel includes leading the way in sustainable operations as we transition more of our sales into growth channels. More than 60% of our customers opt for Click & Collect - that's over 15m orders annually and, of those orders, 9% are picked and packed in stores - the equivalent of four million parcels. As set out in detail on page 30, we became the first major retailer to introduce a Bring your Own Bag initiative for click & collect orders, which will save 10 million pieces of plastic annually. Delivering a high-performance culture is about making M&S a place where everyone can be their best and be themselves. That starts with everyone feeling fairly rewarded and recognised for the work they do. With the rising cost of living front of mind for colleagues, we made a significant investment in store colleague pay across two separate pay increases, including our first ever autumn pay review. The £100m investment means the hourly rate of pay has increased 20% over the past two years and protects M&S as one of the leading reward and benefits offers in retail. As we expand our global reach, the challenge is to do so without compromising the delivery of our net zero goals or the trust in our brand and products. This requires us to work closely with our business partners and this year the international team delivered a 75% increase in the adoption of ""freeze defrost"" delivery methods. This approach enables us to reach our international customers using lower carbon transport methods, such as shipping, while retaining exceptional product quality. Our aim is to structurally lower our cost base and find new and better ways of doing things to make us a more efficient M&S. But better can mean more efficient and more sustainable. In our Foodhalls this year we have reduced food waste by a further 24% on last year through new interventions such as the removal of best before dates on over 300 fruit and vegetables - Read more on page 27. OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES Our plans to reshape M&S for sustainable profitable growth and value creation include the creation of a performance-focused culture, prioritisation of structural cost reduction and disciplined investment in the areas that will deliver long-term shareholder returns.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG DATA CEO INTRODUCTION CONTINUED Accelerating store rotation helps us build an estate that's fit for the future; this means a more efficient, lower energy and lower carbon M&S estate. To support this goal, we have invested in new metering and data capture technology to help us better plan emission reductions into our ongoing store investment programme. Alongside this, we're future-proofing the estate for customers, announcing a new ten-year agreement with BP pulse, which includes the roll-out of 900 electric vehicle charging points to M&S stores over the next two years. Modernising our supply chain will be a key contributor to reaching our net zero target. Our acquisition of Gist - our primary food logistics provider - in September gives us full control of our food supply chain for the first time and the ability to lead decision-making in sustainable investments and innovation. Overall, we have seen early progress, with a 3% reduction in our Scope 1 & 2 emissions (our stores and logistics network) in 2022/23 against the previous year. A compelling customer ecosystem connects every customer engagement across M&S so that we deliver a personalised, rewarding experience. One aspect of personalisation is supporting the causes that matter to our customers, and through Sparks they can select from 35 charities in the UK, from Macmillan to WWF, and we will donate every time they shop with us. It's the most popular feature of Sparks and this year we've donated £2.1m to our Sparks charity partners. Disciplined capital allocation requires a single-minded focus on delivering value creation for our shareholders. This means investing in growth opportunities that are commensurate to risk. Achieving our sustainability goals will require us to pioneer new alternatives and invest in emerging technologies. To help us test the business case for such investment, we have relaunched our Plan A Accelerator Fund - a flm annual fund to support projects tackling climate-related challenges across our value supply chain. This approach allows us to innovate, while building clear evidence of carbon reduction, costs and payback rates to inform any decision to invest at scale. LOOKING AHEAD We cannot tackle the enormous social and environmental challenges our world faces alone; solutions are dependent not just on collaboration with our suppliers but also the inputs of government and wider industry stakeholders. We're playing our part in making changes to how we operate but we can do more to make it easier for our customers to live and enjoy more sustainable lives. We listen closely to understand what really matters to our customers and it is clear the unifying theme is a demand for high-welfare, high-quality food and clothing that's made to last. Underpinning this is their desire to reduce waste - from food waste, to packaging waste and clothing waste. By pioneering new alternatives and collaborating with stakeholders, we are committed to delivering solutions that meet these demands and continue to raise the bar across our business and beyond.

Plan A. because there is no plan b ENVIRONMENT Last year, we reset Plan A to focus on becoming a net zero business across our entire value chain by 2040. During the year, the Science Based Targets initiative approved our 2030 Company-wide emissions reduction target. Achieving net zero means we have to fundamentally change how we make, move and sell our products, and the new leadership team has brought a sharper focus by embedding net zero across the key workstreams within our strategic programme. Stakeholder engagement The scale and scope of our sustainability commitments means they are at the heart of our business operations, and so inform decisions at all levels and across all departments. Understanding and considering our stakeholders' views plays a vital role in this. Our directors are bound by their duties under the Companies Act 2006 to consider the interests of all stakeholder groups. You can read about this, particularly our engagement on broader environmental and social issues, in the Annual Report on page 10. Our supplier partners in particular are key stakeholders for net zero commitments and you can read more about our specific engagement with suppliers on net zero on page 23. To have a real impact in sustainability, we need to make our customers aware of the work we do. This means we need to better understand customers' attitudes and behaviour.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG DATA OUR SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH CONTINUED We have worked with an independent research agency to develop a new brand-reputation measure that each quarter will track customer sentiment and identify the issues and initiatives that shape our ESG reputation. We will establish a baseline over the next year, so we can set targets for improvement. Materiality assessment In last year's report, we said we would review our material sustainability topics and related disclosures. In this context, we have assessed what our customers, colleagues and investors tell us are their priority sustainability topics. To reinforce this, we have reviewed how the sustainability reporting landscape has evolved, considering the views of our principal regulatory bodies, which support standards being developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). This has informed our presentation of this report, and the reporting of our key targets and performance. We also provide references where they apply to specific frameworks or standards our stakeholders consider to be most significant. We will continue to monitor the value of other reporting frameworks, while ensuring we address emerging issues, such as biodiversity, appropriately. Responding to global issues There have, of course, been external factors to contend with this year, which has widened the range of social issues our stakeholders expect us to act on.

Throughout the year, two key activities have meant we are restating this base year in line with our Recalculation Policy: ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL CHANGES TO OUR EMISSIONS BASE YEAR (2016/17) ESG DATA OUR EMISSIONS PERFORMANCE: GROWTH AND REDUCTIONS - Methodology changes were made during the approval process with the Science Based Target initiative, including a move to location-based emissions reporting. A location-based method reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs (using mostly grid-average emission factor data). The move to a location-based method focuses on driving reduction at a location level, and reduces our reliance on market instruments such as Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs).

Overall, in line with the growth in our business our overall footprint has increased, with some of the growth offset with emissions reduction programmes, in our Food business that we are able to quantify. Measuring our footprint, particularly in our supply chain (Scope 3), in a robust way is a challenge that faces the whole retail industry. However, due to the modelling approach for supply chain carbon emissions, a number of programmes that we have in place to deliver emissions reductions cannot yet be seen in our disclosed emissions. This is something we are looking to address through the implementation of new systems and measurement processes to get access to primary data from our supplier partners. For our Food business we expect to have these systems fully operational in the next financial year. For our Clothing & Home business we are currently working with our Digital and Technology team to establish how we integrate data from the HIGG Index into our Clothing & Home footprint.

The majority of our Scope 3 emissions come from our agricultural supply chains, from palm oil and soy used in animal feed, and in our Clothing & Home raw material supply chain from cotton and the production of man-made cellulosic fibres. Intrinsically linked to climate change and of growing importance to our stakeholders is biodiversity loss and nature restoration. We are supporting innovative work on regenerative agriculture initiatives through our Farming with Nature programme and the Better Cotton programme. While we understand the impacts our key raw materials have at a basic level on biodiversity and nature, targets and metrics are a challenge as standards evolve and we continue to stay close to the conversation and emerging guidance. As producers are already feeling the impacts of climate change and declining biodiversity, we've identified the need to support the transition to net zero and to have a greater emphasis on building resilience within our supply chains and particularly where the most vulnerable producers are by building on existing platforms like Fairtrade. ESG DATA OUR OWN BRAND SUPPLY CHAINS High environmental and ethical standards enable us to maintain our differentiated position as a quality retailer in the marketplace. During the past year, we've worked even more closely with our supplier partners to continue to push forward on standards while carefully managing the inflationary cost pressures coming through supply chains. In some cases, the high energy and raw material costs have increased the appetite for efficiency programmes but have also delayed the start of some more innovative projects. Ensuring these standards are upheld means looking beyond our direct supplier partner relationships further down our complex supply chains, where we have less influence and visibility but where many of the bigger impacts occur. That's why industry collaborations are an essential tool for businesses to impact change, particularly in global commodity markets. A focus on improving data and traceability through initiatives such as the Better Cotton Traceability Panel are also key to helping us uphold our standards and deliver on our commitments, particularly on net zero.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL ESG DATA GOVERNANCE HOW WE SOURCE OUR PRODUCTS CONTINUED LOW IMPACT FARMING NET ZERO PRIORITY Ongoing target/commitment We support our farmers in growing lower carbon, responsible food, using fewer pesticides, enhancing their soils, protecting natural resources and driving innovation, and, in doing so, increasing their resilience to the impacts of climate change and water stress. 72% of M&S Food's emissions come from agriculture and around half of these are from livestock, in particular ruminants (beef, lamb, venison). We know customers come to us for the best-quality, highest-welfare meat on the high street. We want to ensure our producers can access the right expertise to understand the farm-efficiency measures that increase productivity and reduce emissions. And we want to support innovation with trials and demonstrator projects to identify new technologies such as in diets and feed rations, that can reduce methane emissions without compromising production. We are also looking for innovation that manages on-farm waste in a more cost-effective way. 2022/23 highlights - Continued the roll out of Farming with Nature programme for our UK fresh produce growers. This requires LEAF (Linking Environment and Farming) marque certification, plus completion of two additional M&S-specific modules, focused on landscape & nature and integrated pest management. We have had high levels of engagement and verification by growers. - 15 farm events with M&S grower groups on approaches to encourage beneficial insects to support pollination, integrated pest management and biodiversity. - Completed a detailed carbon footprint study of our beef supply chain with SRUC, Scotland's Rural College. - Focused on regenerative agriculture in our ""Indicator and Innovation Farm"" network including the launch of our Wildfarmed bread, made from regeneratively farmed wheat. - Shared insights from two M&S-funded trials with M&S potato growers, exploring the opportunities for adoption of regenerative agriculture practices in potato production. - Sponsorship of trials with two M&S growers, installing in-field Agrisound sensors, which use acoustic technology to measure pollinator abundance and support growers to deliver interventions to increase pollinator numbers. 85€ SPOTLIGHT WWF Retailers' Commitment for Nature We are signatories to WWF's Retailers' Commitment for Nature, which works to halt the loss of nature and the risk it poses to our food systems. As part of this we have committed to halve the environmental impact of the UK's shopping baskets by 2030. In the first year of engagement, the ""Basket Metric"" retailers have doubled down on climate, launching a new Retailer Net Zero Collaborative Action Programme to accelerate progress across our supply chains. SPOTLIGHT Beef Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) The work with SRUC gave us a detailed understanding of the carbon impact of the different beef production systems used within our supply base, and identified opportunities to reduce carbon emissions. This study is key to our beef decarbonisation roadmap, and one of seven science-led roadmaps we are developing, one for each of our main animal species, working with industry bodies such as CIEL. These will identify and cost the carbon-reduction activities needed to help us significantly reduce the carbon footprint of our meat by 2030.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG DATA HOW WE SOURCE OUR PRODUCTS CONTINUED RAW MATERIALS: FOOD We are focused on five raw materials: soy, palm, cocoa, tea and coffee. This year's performance update focuses on our progress in two of our priority raw materials relating to deforestation - soy and palm. We maintain our commitment to sourcing 100%-verified sustainable cocoa and all our tea and coffee is Fairtrade. Read more about Fairtrade on page 43 SOY NET ZERO PRIORITY Target 100% of soy to be sourced from verified deforestation and conversion-free (vDCF) supply chains by 2025/26. 2022/23 progress 39% of all soy sourced vDCF. - Our reported total soy tonnage use went up from c.75k tonnes to 100k tonnes. This is because we started digging much deeper into our supply chain through our supplier exchanges and with the implementation of our revised animal feed policy. We are now asking all our key suppliers, including suppliers of dairy products and finished product manufacturers, to provide information on their soy footprint, and the response rate to our soy survey went from 76% in 2021 to 95% in 2022. - We are tracking two sustainability metrics for our soy: · % Verified Deforestation and Conversion Free (vDCF). This includes transitionary mechanisms, such as mass balance, area mass balance, segregated or RTRS regional credits. We are including all our soy - both direct and indirect (soy used in animal feed, including dairy) in this metric. . % Physically Certified Deforestation and Conversion Free. This is soy for which evidence is required of supply claimed to meet a relevant physically certified standard. M&S has aligned our acceptance of standards with the FEFAC benchmark tool and criteria, which include allowing an Area Mass Balance/ Mass Balance/ Segregated chain of custody system, including the purchase of RTRS Regional Credits. This metric applies to soy used in animal feed only (excluding for dairy). - vDCF Soy progress: This year our suppliers reported using a total of 39,127 tonnes of vDCF soy, up from 31,596 tonnes in 2021. However, because significantly more suppliers reported to us on their soy usage than in 2021, the overall % of vDCF soy is lower vs 2021, at 39% this year versus 42% last year. - Physically certified soy progress: this data is subject to a discrete assurance process and we will be reporting on it later in the year. - We have previously reported on the percentage of soy in our supply chain which is ""certified"", also including certificates and credits. This year we have made the decision not to purchase credits ourselves on the basis that they do not tend to be directly connected to soy producers and are not accepted by regulatory bodies and NGOs as evidence of sustainable supply chains which drive the innovation needed to deliver the conservation of vital ecosystems. Instead, we are looking to invest in different financial mechanisms which we believe will bring benefit to the soy producers on the ground so are looking to move away from this metric this year. Read more on page 60 2022/23 highlights - Boosted work across our supply chain to implement commitments under the UK Soy Manifesto via the M&S Animal Feed Policy. - Embedded a dedicated specialist raw materials manager within the Food sustainability team to advance progress on deforestation issues. - Strengthened our reporting through deeper engagement with our supply chain and improved controls. - Continued to play our part in the Retail Soy Group, where we have advocated for the adoption of verified and certified responsibly sourced soy.

"SOCIAL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT GOVERNANCE HOW WE SOURCE OUR PRODUCTS CONTINUED RAW MATERIALS: CLOTHING & HOME Cotton, polyester and man- made cellulosic fibres (MMCFs) account for around 80% of fibres used in our Clothing & Home products. This year, we have continued to make progress towards our target of converting to preferred, more sustainable alternatives by 2025/26, increasing our focus on colleague training and engagement. We regularly review our list of preferred fibres, and select them on the basis that they provide lower impacts on the environment than their conventional counterparts. For example, we source our preferred cotton fibres from programmes that benefit farmers and promote soil health, we source MMCFs from responsibly managed timber or alternative feedstock, and, by using recycled raw materials in our synthetic fibres, we avoid the extraction of new resources. The extraction and production of raw materials also represents a considerable percentage of our Scope 3 emissions. Through sourcing decisions and working closely with our supply chain we are accelerating our focus on reducing impacts at Tier 3 (raw materials processing) and 4 (raw materials extraction). COTTON Target 100% cotton from more responsible sources by 2025/26. 2022/23 progress 100% of the cotton in our clothing is sourced through Better Cotton or with organic and recycled certifications. We have maintained this position since 2019 by working closely with our supplier partners and through industry collaborations. 90% of the cotton in our homeware in our 2023 spring/summer range was from more responsible sources. There is still a small amount of conventional cotton remaining in our home textiles; we are making good progress in converting this by working closely with Better Cotton. In the 2023 spring/summer range, homeware represented 19% of total cotton used across Clothing & Home.

This has been a major focus across key departments and we are on track to reach our 2025/26 target. This data is subject to a discrete assurance process linked to our financing and is scheduled to be publish in autumn 2023. Read more on page 62 Go to our approach to sourcing polyester SPOTLIGHT Collaboration M&S is represented on several of the Textile Exchange roundtables on raw materials, ensuring we benefit from industry insight, as well as contribute to sharing knowledge and conversing between peers. We will also be joining working groups on specific topics this year, to support achieving the Textile Exchange 2030 Climate+ strategic goal to reduce 45% CO,e emissions from fibre and material production. MAN-MADE CELLULOSIC FIBRES Target 100% MMCF from preferred sources by 2025/26. 2022/23 progress 45% of our spring/summer range was from preferred sources. We are making progress towards our 2025/26 target. Preferred fibres are selected on the basis that they have a low risk of deforestation in their supply chain, and are made using the best available technology.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG DATA HOW WE SOURCE OUR PRODUCTS CONTINUED DATA IMPROVEMENTS AND A FOCUS ON TRACEABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY Improving the traceability of raw materials helps us address potential human rights and environmental risks more effectively by tracing fibres as they move through the supply chain. As they are our greatest volume of raw materials, our initial focus is on finding solutions for cotton, MMCFs and polyester. Finding the right partners and tools is essential to build traceability at scale, and will enable us to access the data we need to achieve net zero. Cotton traceability M&S became a Pioneer Member of Better Cotton in 2009. This initiative has made real progress using a mass balance approach. This means that Better Cotton farmers benefit from the demand for Better Cotton in equivalent volumes to those we use in our products. Training and support by Better Cotton has resulted in really positive environmental impacts such as improved soil health and reduced water, fertiliser and pesticide usage while allowing farmers to improve their yield and profit. However specific fibre traceability has been a challenge and so the next iteration of our partnership is focused on traceability. Since 2021, we've been part of the Better Cotton Traceability Panel, a collaboration of industry stakeholders working to develop and grow physical traceability along Better Cotton's supply chain. This year we piloted new requirements to the Better Cotton's Chain of Custody model in India, adding physical segregation and traceability as cotton progresses through the supply chain before reaching stores in autumn/winter 23. While we believe in the positive impact that using Better Cotton through mass balance has had for cotton farmers, physical segregation is the natural next step, and we are committed to supporting the expansion of this work. Go to human rights in the cotton supply chain in our Modern Slavery Statement Piloting new traceability platforms Finding a tool that supports us in upholding our stringent policy and certification requirements has been a focus for us over the past few years. With many new solutions coming to market, we have carried out a detailed review and, following a successful proof of concept, we are scaling up a pilot with Textiles Genesis. With an initial focus on the traceability of MMCF fibres, this will allow us to understand more about the challenges of tracking fibres along the different transformation stages, from raw material to finished goods. To date, 600,000 products have been traced from fibre source to the garment maker. Cotton transparency M&S was one of the first major companies to ban cotton from the Xinjiang region of China. We also don't source from Turkmenistan or Uzbekistan because of ongoing ethical trading concerns in those regions. All our suppliers must declare the cotton country of origin to us. We've introduced new technology to ensure this policy is enforced. We have been testing samples of cotton on a monthly basis through the Oritain™ lab. Oritain™ applies forensic and data science to detect naturally occurring elements in a product or raw material - allowing us to confirm where the cotton comes from and verify any consistency with the banned source origins. SPOTLIGHT Leather traceability M&S joined the Traceability Working Group Panel in 2021, working alongside other brands and stakeholders from the leather industry to articulate traceability needs that address deforestation and animal welfare, and to develop tools and activities to implement at scale. > Read more on page 39 Sustainability Report 2023 22",0.18060855810855814
"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG DATA HOW WE MAKE OUR PRODUCTS INTRODUCTION As an own-brand retailer, with longstanding and close relationships with our trusted supplier partners, we are uniquely positioned to find ways of reducing emissions and cutting waste. We have made strong progress this year, particularly in Food, where we have aligned our supplier strategy to our net zero target, supporting key supplier partners in putting plans in place. In Clothing & Home, as we shape our new sourcing strategy, we have considered how we ensure it will achieve our net zero targets. Our efforts over the past decade have helped us identify our hotspots of high emissions, and the key strategic suppliers which account for the majority of these emissions. Our priority is to work more closely with these supplier partners on net zero, outlining the outcomes we expect to see in their operations and supply chains. Working with these suppliers has made it clear that one of the biggest challenges to rapid decarbonisation lies in emissions data, which is not yet sufficiently detailed or automated, and does not allow us to track our progress in reduction. Our focus over the past year has been to identify programmes and partnerships that will help overcome this challenge. In our Food business we have joined Manufacture 2030, a cross-industry platform that supports our supplier partners to measure, manage and reduce their emissions. The software allows our partners to share their emissions data with us and their other partners. In Clothing & Home we continue our involvement in the Sustainable Apparel Coalition a global- multi stakeholder alliance. Through our membership we use the Higg Index, a suite of tools that provide a standard measurement of supply chain sustainability, providing the industry a common language to describe sustainability performance. We know efficiency measures and investment in renewables alone will not be sufficient for us to achieve the emissions reductions we've signed up to, so we've also started to put plans in place to facilitate the development of innovative solutions that can close the gap.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG DATA HOW WE MAKE OUR PRODUCTS CONTINUED FOOD MANUFACTURING EMISSIONS REDUCTION NET ZERO PRIORITY 2022/23 progress Top 10 suppliers (based on their emissions) now have net zero plans in place and plans to source renewable electricity by 2025/26. Our top 10 suppliers account for 53% of Food Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions from purchased goods and services so we have prioritised engagement with this set of suppliers as it is vital we understand their targets to reduce emissions and align with our net zero ambition. All these companies already have strong plans in place, and over the next year we will focus on building these into our Joint Business Plan process. 2022/23 highlights/action We launched ""six key asks"" - at our Technical Supplier Conference in October 2022, and more recently at our first ""Sustainability Supplier Exchange"", in January, with 250 suppliers participating. 1. Net zero - set a science-based, 2040 net zero target and roadmap for Scopes 1, 2 and 3. 2. Purchase 100% renewable electricity by 2025. 3. Purchase verified deforestation and conversion-free animal feed by 2025 (with a plan in place by 2023). 4. Packaging - focus on quality, innovation and sustainability, and remove plastic where possible. 5. Food waste - implement a food waste redistribution plan by 2023. 6. Human rights - implement our M&S Standard, which also includes Worker Voice, for medium-risk sites, as well as Human Rights Due Diligence. During the year, we improved our systems for tracking reduced emissions by signing up to the data aggregator platform, Manufacture 2030. This enables us to see how our top 100 suppliers based on emissions are decarbonising. We will use Manufacture 2030 to track progress towards our renewable electricity commitment, by asking our suppliers to complete the questionnaire and provide data for their manufacturing sites. Our plans for 2023/24 - Getting 100% of our top 100 suppliers (based on emissions) signed up to Manufacture 2030. - Working with Manufacture 2030 and our suppliers to build strong plans to achieve our net zero commitments. - Working with Manufacture 2030 on identifying how we monitor our more- complex supply chains, ensuring we include raw material suppliers who supply us directly but also supply through other Tier 1 suppliers. 859 CASE STUDY SHARPENING OUR DATA SYSTEM'S TOOLS TO MEASURE emissions CHALLENGE One of the biggest challenges in reducing Scope 3 emissions lies in having access to supplier-specific emissions data and finding a way to aggregate emissions data across complex supply chains. Until now, modelling of emissions using secondary (industry average) data has been sufficient for us to identify hotspots and formulate plans. However, as we now move into implementation, we need new ways of tracking progress at a more detailed level and more frequently. M&S ACTION During the year we started work with a carbon footprinting platform, Mondra, that we believe can better help us track our emissions across our supply chain. Mondra is a data insights platform that can combine primary data from M&S suppliers when available with secondary emissions data to generate a more accurate set of product carbon footprints across our Food business than ever before. The platform interfaces with our existing product specification system to identify the specific raw materials and quantities of ingredients in our products. During the year, we benefited from an Innovate UK grant that permitted us to pilot Mondra's approach with a key supplier - Samworth Brothers - and a limited number of products. This was successful and we are now working further with Mondra to support them in a second phase of platform development, by assessing footprints of more complex products this year. The technology has gained significant industry interest and we are also now part of the Mondra-BRC coalition which has convened a wide number of stakeholders across the food industry with the aim of aligning on one solution for this complex issue. IMPACT This will enable us to have a tool that buyers and product developers can use to ensure they consider the environmental impacts of product choices.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG DATA REDUCING WASTE AND PROTECTING RESOURCES INTRODUCTION Our customers consistently rank packaging, and reducing food and textile waste, as top priorities. While these are relatively small sources of emissions for us, it is right that we take action. We've made some great strides this year. In our Food business, the hard work of our store colleagues to improve processes, alongside new technology, resulted in a step change in food redistribution, which jumped from 56% to 79% of our edible surplus. Overall food waste also declined, aided by interventions such as the elimination of best before dates on more than 300 fruit and vegetable products. There has also been a visible change in the removal of plastic in our stores in key categories such as bakery, nuts and fresh produce. In addition our 'Refilled' model for laundry and household products has been well-received. Customers find the service convenient and we are achieving high bottle return rates. In Clothing & Home we have reinstated our hanger-retention programme - encouraging customers to leave hangers behind in store for reuse. Early feedback for our Bring Your Own Bag (BYOB) initiative for Click & Collect which asks customers to bring their own bag is also positive. We have also continued to test and learn to better understand customer behaviour around the circular economy. FOOD WASTE NET ZERO PRIORITY Target Food waste reduced by 50% by 2030 against a baseline of 2017/18. 2022/23 progress 46% O reduction in food waste (last year 29%) against a baseline of 2017/18. Read more on page 63 2022/23 highlights - The progress delivered this year is due to factors including the removal of best before dates and replacement with Julian codes on 300 lines of fruit and vegetables in store, and our strong food surplus redistribution work. In addition, we carried out a comprehensive review of the accuracy of our actual food waste data. CASE STUDY TURNING SURPLUS LOAVES INTO FROZEN GARLIC bread CHALLENGE Our in-store bakers create the freshest, highest quality bread daily for our customers. We believe each loaf is too good to waste and our customers agree. M&S ACTION At the end of each day, we take unsold baguettes and boules - baked in-store daily - prepare and fill them with garlic butter, and then sell them as frozen garlic bread from £1, with an extended shelf life of 30 days. IMPACT The scheme, which launched in 2020, is currently live in 253 stores and we have sold over two million of the re-purposed loaves. Due to its popularity, we are now expanding this offer to an additional 125 stores in April 2023 and introducing two new products. SPOTLIGHT What matters to our customers Reducing food waste is hugely important to families - M&S' latest Family Matters Index revealed that 72% of UK families are taking steps to reduce household waste. Over half (55%) of families say it's important that the shops they buy from make it easier for them to make more- sustainable choices.

Read more on page 63 2022/23 highlights - Our step change in performance during the year was due to the introduction of food-waste redistribution as a measurable KPI for all stores, which we identified as a key action following a review last year. - While the majority of our food surplus still goes to local causes, we have reviewed our food surplus policy to allow our store colleagues to take home food at a reduced rate. It has been a popular step change for our colleauges. - We reinvigorated our seven-year partnership with Neighbourly, with a clear objective of pairing more stores and charities, to facilitate an uplift in redistribution. - We reissued our policy to suppliers to encourage them to redistribute any edible surplus M&S products that may arise in manufacture, and we are starting to track this data. - During 2022/23, we took action in response to feedback from customers and colleagues who wanted to donate items themselves to help people in their community struggling with the cost-of- living crisis. To enable this we installed donation points in store and arranged for donated items to be collected by local charity representatives via Neighbourly. === CASE STUDY M&S FOOD REACHES MILESTONE OF MEALS DONATED TO CHARITIES ACROSS THE UK 60 million meals CHALLENGE IMPACT Neighbourly's community survey found that 83% of groups are already seeing more demand and 73% say they would like more food items to be able to support those who use their services. More than 2,700 good causes, from afterschool clubs to food banks, have benefited from the donations of edible unsold fresh, ambient and chilled food from M&S stores, with more than 6,000 benefiting from the partnership with Neighbourly in total. M&S ACTION M&S Food has donated more than 60 million meals to local charities over the past seven years through our partnership with community investment platform Neighbourly, designed to tackle food waste in store.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG DATA REDUCING WASTE AND PROTECTING RESOURCES CONTINUED Plastic packaging is one of the hot topics that we know our customers and colleagues want us to take action on. We are working to remove plastic packaging and are supporting the UK Plastics Pact. We are working right across the business, but our priority focus is on the key hotspots where we use the most plastic or where it is most impacting our customers. Over 80% of all plastic product packaging is used by the M&S Food business. Of the plastic packaging that is used by Clothing & Home, almost 70% is in clothing hangers. That is why food packaging and closed-loop hangers have been our priority areas for focus in 2022/23. FOOD PLASTIC PACKAGING REDUCTION NET ZERO PRIORITY Target Remove 1 billion units of plastic from the packaging portfolio by the end 2027/28, from a base year of 2017/18. Remove 75 million units in 2022/23. 2022/23 progress - We have achieved our in-year target of removing 75 million pieces of plastic packaging. A further performance update will follow in autumn 2023 after assurance, as this data is subject to a discrete assurance process linked to our financing. Read more on page 56 2022/23 highlights - Projects to remove plastic packaging at scale from existing products across the food hall were launched throughout this year and a pipeline of future projects identified for 2023/24 and beyond. Examples of plastic removals this year have included: - Moving croissants into cardboard trays. - Placing Food on the Move nuts into new pouch packaging. - Introduction of plastic-free packaging for teacakes. - Moving tomatoes into cardboard trays (see case study). - We rolled out M&S Refilled, encouraging customers to reuse and return laundry and homecare products to reduce plastic. This is popular with customers, who find it a convenient service. - We are pausing wider roll-out of Fill your Own (refillable groceries such as nuts and grains) as this isn't working from a customer perspective. CASE STUDY TOMATO PACKAGING GOES green CHALLENGE The challenge was how to move to a new format of packaging for British Collection vine tomatoes to reduce plastic waste but without affecting product life negatively. M&S ACTION The new packaging replaces a plastic sleeve with recyclable cardboard and a small amount of plastic film to preserve the freshness of the tomatoes, but still allow it to be recyclable in the UK cardboard waste stream.

Read more on page 64 SPOTLIGHT Improving packaging data A big focus during the year was close working with our product supplier partners and our digital and data teams to improve the quality and granularity of packaging data in line with UK regulatory changes to the UK's Plastic Tax and Extended Producer Responsibility. We are also updating the recycling logos on the back of our packs to make it easier for customers to know what can be recycled. 2022/23 highlights - Where plastic packaging cannot yet be removed, we are working to ensure it is easily recyclable by our customers. Strong progress has been made and the vast majority of plastic packaging in our Food Halls is recyclable via household recycling collections. We want to get this to 100% (and are measuring this by assessing whether the packaging is recyclable according to OPRL definitions). - However, not all plastics are yet recyclable via this route. Problem packaging items include multilayer films, lidding films, labels, nets and other items such as tags and sachets. - To address this, last year we rolled out collection points for these plastics in over 500 stores as an interim solution to collect and recycle this packaging while we work with organisations such as WRAP; and the UK Plastics Pact to improve the household collection of soft plastics. - In the last year we have started to work with a recycling company which takes this plastic waste collected in stores, sorts it and processes it into new materials. - A very small amount of the packaging we collect in stores is not recyclable with current UK technology. We are taking forward conversations with a range of stakeholders to identify the best solutions to recycle these last few problematic plastics in the UK. - Going forward, we will report progress against the UK Plastics Pact 2025 target, for 100% of plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable. CLOTHING & HOME PACKAGING 2022/23 highlights We operate a closed-loop hanger recycling programme, through which we ask customers to leave hangers in store and send them back to a reuse centre, where they are sorted and sent back to garment suppliers for reuse. Any unsuitable (e.g. damaged) hangers are recycled to be made into new hangers. All our hangers are made with recycled plastic. During the year we've reinforced our policy across stores to ensure that we do not give out hangers to customers when they purchase an item. We are also working with supplier partners to understand where we can remove hangers before despatching online orders. For the remaining small amount of other plastic product packaging used in our clothing business, we continue to implement changes to packaging design to reduce the number of items of plastic packaging being used. For example, we are reducing the amount of bags used for online deliveries through our new BYOB click and collect initiative (see case study opposite). In Beauty we are working on a solution that would allow the customer to send back beauty packaging from products bought online for recycling. Go to our progress in Clothing & Home packaging CASE STUDY BRING YOUR OWN bag CHALLENGE During the year, we launched a new click & collect initiative to reduce use of plastic packaging. M&S ACTION BYOB - Bring Your Own Bag - was rolled out across 251 stores in February. The initiative takes away the need for the traditional plastic carrier across online orders that are picked and packed at the collection store, by asking customers to bring their own bag. The ambition is to expand the initiative to all click & collect orders in the longer term. IMPACT Customers participating in the trial praised the approach as ""simple and straightforward"" and an easy way to help them reduce their own plastic consumption. We are the first large retailer to adopt this approach which will save 10 million pieces of plastic annually.

"OUR APPROACH PERFORMANCE SUMMARY ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE DRIVING EFFICIENCIES INTRODUCTION This year, our focus across our stores, warehouses and logistics footprints has been on driving efficiencies, reducing waste, improving our greenhouse gas emission measurement and tracking capability and investing in our store estate for the future. In September 2022, we acquired Gist, our Food logistics provider, a move that allows us to accelerate our plan to modernise our Food supply chain network to support growth. ESG DATA LOCATION-BASED SCOPE 1 AND 2 GHG EMISSIONS (000 TCO2E) FLEET Fuel M&S 2 Refrigerant leakage Renewable electricity UK AND ROI PROPERTY Gas 41 Refrigerant leakage 36 2 Heating fuel oils 1 District heating and cooling A key priority has been the implementation of a Group-wide digital solution to track our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, which will enable our colleagues to consider the impact on emissions as they make operational and investment decisions on a location-by-location basis. As part of this system design and implementation, we ran a number of workshops and upskilling sessions for colleagues in our Property business, International operations, Clothing & Home logistics team and since the acquisition of Gist, colleagues within Gist. We know there is a lot to do as we transition our legacy infrastructure to net zero and we are highly dependent on the timing across the national infrastructures, particularly around degasification and alternative fuels. Purchased electricity INTERNATIONAL PROPERTY 18 3 Refrigerant leakage In the short term, our immediate focus is on driving efficiency, which in the past year has been a strong commercial priority. Although a small part of our overall footprint, our colleagues in the International business are also playing their part, reviewing how we can use lower carbon routes to send product to our international markets, investing in LED lighting and using the new digital emissions reporting platform to aid greater visibility of data at a site level. SPOTLIGHT Gist acquisition In September 2022, we acquired Gist, a longstanding logistics partner to the Food business.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG DATA DRIVING EFFICIENCIES CONTINUED NET ZERO PROPERTY & NET ZERO LOGISTICS NET ZERO PRIORITY Target 34% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025/26 against 2016/17 baseline. 55% reduction in carbon emissions by 2029/30 against 2016/17 baseline (SBTi approved*). Net zero across our own business by 2035. *Marks and Spencer plc commits to reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 55% by 2030 from a 2017 base year. Marks and Spencer plc also commits to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions 55% within the same timeframe. SPOTLIGHT Sphera We know that having the right systems in place to manage and report on our greenhouse gas emissions data is key. This year we have implemented Sphera, an ESG performance management system that we are now using to collect, analyse and report data on Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. The benefits of introducing this system have been to provide more frequent reporting to management; give data access and analysis at different levels and areas of the business; codify the process and reduce the chance of human error; improve controls and verification to support assurance; and ensure we are in line with the market. 2022/23 progress 32% reduction of total Scope 1 and 2 location- based greenhouse gas emissions, against 2016/17 base year (Target 55% reduction). 3% reduction of total Scope 1 and 2 location- based greenhouse gas emissions, against 2021/22. Reductions were driven by a fall in reported emissions from refrigerant leakage, which were down 18% on last year, caused by a return to normal levels of maintenance visits to top up refrigerant, following a spike the previous year, when maintenance visits resumed post-Covid lockdowns. Emissions from purchased electricity also reduced and were 4% down on last year. Read more on page 57 UK AND ROI PROPERTY NET ZERO PRIORITY 2022/23 highlights/action We invested in LED lighting, voltage optimisation, aerofoils and introduced doors on fridges, delivering emissions savings as well as reducing operational costs. Behaviour change has also been a key focus as we encouraged our stores to be ""Energy Super Savers"" identifying opportunities such as using night blinds, switching off lights, and reviewing bakery schedules. This year we have continued the roll-out of new automated meter readers (AMRs), to improve the quality of electricity, gas and water data across the UK store estate. The project, which began in February 2022, provides accurate reporting on our energy consumption and on related greenhouse emissions as a result. The AMRs have now been installed in 80% of the store estate and will complete the remaining 20% by June 2023. In parallel we designed and implemented a Group-wide digital Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas reporting system, which the automatic meter data feeds into. For the year ahead, further related capital expenditure opportunities have been approved for investment providing both emissions reductions and operational energy savings. CASE STUDY PARTNERING WITH BP PULSE TO BRING EV CHARGING POINTS TO customers CHALLENGE To support the UK government's target of zero emissions motoring, investment needs to be made into the charging infrastructure to make it more convenient for drivers. M&S ACTION M&S and bp pulse have agreed a 10-year deal to roll-out electric vehicle charging (EV) infrastructure across our store network. The agreement will see M&S and bp pulse BP's electric vehicle charging business, work together to install an initial 900 electric vehicle charge points across the M&S UK store estate in the next two years. IMPACT The roll-out will significantly expand bp pulse's network, growing the UK's charging network and adding up to 40,000 kWhs of charging capacity to the UK's EV infrastructure. The agreement forms part of M&S' plans to build a store estate fit for the future and make it easier for customers to live a lower carbon lifestyle.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG DATA DRIVING EFFICIENCIES CONTINUED INTERNATIONAL 2022/23 highlights/action Investments in our data systems have given us greater visibility of energy data at a site level across our owned operations in Greece, Czech Republic and our joint venture in India. We have also committed to converting all our stores to 100% LED lighting across our owned operations by 2025. This year we reached 63% of this target with retrofits in a further 15 stores, with plans to retrofit a further 18 stores in 2023/24. M&S TAGEPIANE SUPPLY CHAINS Scope 3 Air freight of fresh food product is the single biggest contributor to our International business carbon emissions, accounting for 44% of the total international footprint. There is a significant opportunity to reduce emissions by switching the transportation of our chilled product offering to the freeze defrost programme. This allows us to ship product rather than fly it without any negative impact on freshness or product quality. Doing so requires technical adjustments to the product specification and methods of production. During 2022, we grew the number of freeze defrost lines by 75% from 400 to 700. Our target is to have 1,300 lines by 2025. GISt U2256 DAF CF In November 2022, we held an initial Franchise Partner engagement on net zero sharing our decarbonisation roadmap and targets and best practice across markets. As part of this engagement, we have started to collect data from our franchise partners, allowing us to understand more about the differences between each partner's emissions and the markets in which they operate. SUPPLY CHAIN LOGISTICS NET ZERO PRIORITY 2022/23 highlights/action We have made good progress to reduce emissions from our Clothing and Home Supply Chain Logistics fleet, however these fleet reductions have been offset by growth in our Foods business, and so we have seen an overall increase in our total fleet emissions. Net zero logistics challenge Reaching net zero remains a challenge for the logistics industry, with no clear low emission technological solutions currently available at scale on the Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) market. Today we are progressing with emissions reductions via network efficiencies, and moving towards lower emissions bridging fuels and available technology solutions. We are committed to working with the industry and sharing best practice through the BRC Climate Roadmap Logistics Pathway and Sustainable Logistics Forum. Interim efficiency actions In the immediate term, our focus is on driving behavioural change and identifying efficiencies. Across both our Food and Clothing & Home logistics networks we focused on driver training and the use of telematics to improve fuel efficiency. We have been working to improve our Clothing & Home network efficiency through improved tote and vehicle fill, reviewing delivery schedules, and utilising double-decker trailers. Technological solutions We are also investing in technological solutions. Across our Food network, Gist have been piloting several innovations including a new rigid fleet with power-take off (PTO) technology to run fridges electrically via the cab's engine, and electric trailers with roof solar panels to charge on-board batteries. In our Clothing & Home network we have introduced 35 bio-LNG tractor units into our fleet to replace end-of-life diesel assets. These have the potential to provide up to an 80% emissions reduction compared to diesel. ""Cleaner burn fuels"" serve as a bridging option to reduce CO,e, while alternative low emissions technologies develop at scale for industry wide use, and support with the rapid decarbonisation needed to reach our 2030 target.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ANIMAL WELFARE INTRODUCTION Our founders knew that value means much more than price. It means giving customers assurance that we source raw materials responsibly to protect the planet for tomorrow, and provide confidence that we treat the people who make and sell our products fairly. This means setting the standards for others to follow, whether that's in animal welfare or product traceability. It's why we sell more RSPCA Assured products than any other retailer. ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE FOOD Animal health and welfare is an integral part of a sustainable food system. We believe animal welfare has an impact on food quality and so use ingredients that have been farmed to high welfare standards. We work towards the highest standards in this area guided by our Animal Health and Welfare Policy. 81% of UK adults believe it is important for food retailers to focus on the better treatment of farm animals *. We will never compromise on the welfare of our farmers and their animals. Our stringent welfare standards ensure animals have a good diet and easy access to fresh water, adequate shelter and comfortable resting areas, sufficient space and timely treatment if they become sick or injured. M&S is long recognised as being the UK leader in farm animal welfare. We were first awarded Tier 1 status in the Business Benchmark in Farm Animal Welfare in 2013, and have retained this status ever since - the only UK retailer to do so. Since 2002, we have been awarded 11 separate animal welfare awards from Compassion in World Farming, and we have also received a number of recognitions from RSPCA including the Sustained Excellence Award. We have invested heavily in RSPCA Assurance and now sell the largest range of RSPCA Assured products in the world. Go to our Food approach to animal welfare ESG DATA ANIMAL WELFARE STANDARDS Ongoing commitment Maintain #1 ranking among retailers with the highest number of species within M&S Food product range adhering to RSPCA Assured certification. 2022/23 highlights/action #1 Ranking among retailers with the highest number of species within the M&S Food product range adhering to RSPCA Assured certification. We partner with the RSPCA and adopt their standards to improve the welfare of animals throughout our supply chain. We have always been committed to ensuring that the welfare of all animals used in the production of our products is safeguarded. Our goal is to ensure our suppliers adopt and implement the highest practical and commercially viable standards of farm animal welfare across our supply base at every stage of the animal's life, and demonstrate continuous improvement in farm animal health and welfare standards. The RSPCA Assured logo on M&S packaging provides independent assurance that any animals involved in production have been reared to the RSPCA's strict farm animal welfare standards and had a good quality of life. CHICKEN Target By autumn 2022, all our fresh chicken will be higher-welfare, slower-reared, British and RSPCA Assured. 2022/23 progress 100% 100% higher-welfare, slower-reared chicken. 2022 highlights/action In September 2022, we met our 2021 commitment to become the first major retailer to sell only higher-welfare, slower- reared chicken across our full range of fresh chicken products. Our Oakham™ Gold chickens are fed on a multigrain diet to support their slower growth and muscle development. Birds also have 20% more space alongside an enhanced environment, with more pecking aids and perches to encourage natural behaviours. The introduction of Oakham™ Gold chicken means all the fresh chicken we sell is now slower-reared, British and RSPCA Assured. Moving to higher-welfare, slower-reared chicken was not without challenges as in the short term it will increase greenhouse gas emissions due to increased animal feed requirements.

We are building welfare objectives into our species-decarbonisation plans, to ensure any increase in carbon emissions from higher-welfare activities we build into - and compensate for - in our overall net zero reduction plans. M&S' move to offer 100% slower- reared, RSPCA Assured fresh chicken is the biggest positive change to chicken farming in a generation. It's a landmark achievement for animal welfare, which we hope will set a leading example for other retailers.""

We're committed to working collaboratively with suppliers, civil society, governments and other businesses on human rights to inform our approach, share our experiences and help address root causes and influence systemic positive change. Enhancing the lives of people in our supply chain Enhancing the lives of our local communities, people who work for us and our supply partners is a core value that underpins our work. SPOTLIGHT Our Group-wide policies and procedures We have several Group-wide policies in place that are relevant to responsible sourcing, all of which are signed off at director level. We continually review and develop our policies with input from in-house experts, suppliers and external stakeholders.

For the vast majority of seasonal workers coming to the UK, English is not their first language. Understanding this, we have been instrumental in the development of the Seasonal Workers module of the ""Just Good Work"" app which gives workers their rights when working in the UK in their own language before they arrive. To date, this module has been downloaded 19,000 times. 7 Go to our Modern Slavery Statement Worker Voice In addition to our ethical compliance programme and suppliers' own surveys, our Worker Voice programme allows us to hear directly from workers anonymously and allows us to understand sentiment at our supplier partner sites. This year, through our delivery partner nGaje, we received 30,967 responses, which equates to nearly a third of workers on site taking part. The results allow us to agree appropriate and targeted action plans developed by our supplier partners. Our focus for 2023/24 will be to facilitate trend analysis from this data. Training and upskilling our supply base A core pillar of our Food Human Rights Standard is the requirement for our supplier partners to embed a pro-active Human Rights Due Diligence ""HRDD"" approach in their own operations and supply chain. In June 2022, we made our HRDD and Remedy Guidance publicly available on our website for suppliers to use, reflecting our commitment to protect and enhance livelihoods. Our focus is on our highest risk/strategic supplier partners and this year we reviewed 45 supplier partners' approaches to HRDD and their KPIs. In April 2022, we engaged with 60 suppliers at the Food Supplier Exchange event, sharing experience and best practice on embedding HRDD into their business. We held further supplier exchange sessions through the year on modern slavery and our broader sustainability approach. Over the same period, we delivered a webinar with the Sedex Social Impact team on the best way to establish measurable KPIs for human rights.

Understand- ing the challenges, particularly for migrant workers in this supply chain, M&S has worked with the Fair Labor Association and other brands since 2019 to support our key suppliers. Every summer, tens of thousands of seasonal workers move across Turkey to work in agricultural production. They travel as families, moving from crop to crop for six to eight months each year. The Harvesting the Future programme delivers training for suppliers and producers on decent work principles and responsible recruitment and facilitates the registration of labour contractors with the Turkish Employment Agency. Our continued participation in the programme allows us to support our supply chain partners to ensure good working conditions for the seasonal workforce in our supply chain. Human Rights Impact Assessment As part of our Food Human Rights Strategy we have committed to undertake Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIA), which provide an in-depth analysis of the salient risks to people in our supply chains. Read about the findings and actions from our Human Rights Impact Assessment of the Kenyan smallholder tea supply chain in the case study. CASE STUDY HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF THE KENYAN SMALLHOLDER TEA SUPPLY CHAIN BY partner Africa CHALLENGE Kenya is the world's third largest tea-producing country, where around 650,000 smallholders account for more than 55% of the country's total tea production. The industry has come under pressure from climate change, the Covid-19 pandemic, rising production costs and falling tea prices amid depressed global demand in the smallholder sector. This has compounded well-publicised human rights challenges across the tea sector. M&S ACTION In partnership with Waitrose, we completed and published our Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA) of the Kenyan smallholder tea supply chain. As an important origin for both brands, this study ensured we were able to gain a deeper understanding of our shared supply chain in Kenya, hearing the views of smallholder farmers, hired labourers and factory workers in the industry. The findings have been publicly shared along with an action plan that was developed in consultation with the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) and our supplier, Ringtons. In 2023, we will be working towards completion of the action plan and will be reporting on our progress. We will collaborate with the Kenyan Tea Development Agency and other stakeholders to develop projects and initiatives that deliver improvements across the areas highlighted in the HRIA. We will assess where we have existing models and frameworks in place with other stakeholders that can be adopted by this group of suppliers and we will also share learning to facilitate scaling these up.

We contribute more Fairtrade Premium than any other UK retailer, enabling our producers to invest in their future. We know that M&S customers have a high level of trust in the FAIRTRADE Mark, and this year we made Fairtrade more visible in our cafés and on takeaway cups. We also included it on the back of cereal packaging as part of our Look Behind the Label campaign. Whilst M&S continue to be committed to sourcing 100% of our tea as Fairtrade, ongoing challenges in the region have meant that this has not included some of our Assamese tea where its is currently unavailable as Fairtrade certified. We are working closely with our supplier partners and the Fairtrade Foundation to help address the challenges in the Assam region and to agree a Fairtrade model that benefits workers in Assam, while also giving M&S access to this vital ingredient for our tea blends. 2022/23 highlights: Food Living wage bananas In January 2023, we signed up to the ""UK Retailer Commitment on Living Wages in Banana Supply Chains"" with a commitment for workers in our banana supply chains to receive a living wage by 2027 alongside our retailer partners.

As a result of any findings, suppliers are expected to implement remediation plans. The ethical audit process, including grading, escalation and audit follow-up activity, is managed by our specialist Sourcing Office compliance teams located in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Sir Lanka, Turkey, and Vietnam. Complementing audit, Worker Voice is a valuable tool that allows us to gather direct worker feedback and complements our well-established factory audit programme and risk assessment methodology. This year we expanded our programme to a total of 138 factories in seven countries to date (Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Pakistan, Turkey and Vietnam). We have tested a variety of approaches, from digital solutions to in-person interviews. The pilots enable us to understand the experiences of people working in our supply chain in different factories and countries, identify common trends across our supply base and respond to feedback from workers. We will continue to scale this programme and will also develop a set of Worker Voice principles to guide best practice. In the year ahead we also plan to roll-out the ""Everyone's Business"" App, a digital human rights tool that will enable M&S colleagues to participate in factory due diligence by reporting their visit observations remotely This will strengthen our factory monitoring for ethical compliance by empowering our buying, merchandising and technology teams to participate in it. Lower Tier due diligence In order to extend evaluation of social compliance further down our supply chain, the Higg Facility Social and Labour Module ""FSLM"" through our membership of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition ""SAC"", is now an approved assessment methodology alongside other recognised social compliance audits. This year, 175 Tier 2 sites shared their FSLM with us. In addition to these assessments, our social compliance teams in our sourcing regions have carried out 189 Tier 2 visits. 175 Tier 2 sites shared their FSLM. 189 Tier 2 facility visits. We recognise the complexity of verifying social compliance standards further down our supply chain, where as a brand we may have no direct business trading relationship. Therefore, we will work together with our Tier 1 suppliers to ensure these standards are cascaded down the supply chain. Our focus this year will be to develop our corrective action process for Tier 2 to strengthen engagement with our supply base in order to drive improvements by resolving any compliance issues found. Research and risk assessment Our due diligence approach is informed by regularly updating our internal policies and standards, external research and risk assessments. For example, in 2022/23: - We commissioned research into living wages through a combination of benchmarking exercises, desk-based research, and field research in factories and communities. - We contributed to a research study entitled ""Worker and Management Experiences of Workplace Grievance Mechanisms in Cambodia's Garment Sector"", alongside other brands. - We renewed our assessment of key risks in all of our sourcing countries based on country-level risk indicators and industry- specific risks, commissioned with an expert ethical consultancy. - We co-funded the Myanmar Enhanced Due Diligence Sectoral Assessment, commissioned by the Ethical Trade Initiative (ETI). - We use this external research and risk assessment information, in addition to the data we collect from our supply base, to inform and update our responsible sourcing strategy.

In 2022, we co-funded a research assessment into the situation in Myanmar, investigating the human rights risks, the economic links to the military and the socio-economic impact on workers entitled the Myanmar Enhanced Due Diligence Sectoral Assessment, which was published in September 2022. The findings confirmed that it was no longer possible for our Global Sourcing Principles to be upheld in Myanmar and as we do not tolerate any human rights abuses within any part of our supply chain, we began working towards a responsible exit from Myanmar. In October 2022, we announced our exit from the country in line with our Responsible Exit policy. 7 Go to our Modern Slavery Statement Image courtesy of International Labour Organisation Pakistan Accord We were a signatory of the original Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh (2013) which aimed for sustainable improvements to working conditions in the Bangladesh garment industry.

The POWER 2 programme provides female workers with training across gender balance awareness, technical skills, and financial and digital literacy to address root causes of gender inequality at work and in the community. More than 130 factory workers received training this year, with feedback showing increased confidence both inside and outside the workplace, improved problem-solving skills, and increased independence in the community. CASE STUDY MARKS AND START PROGRAMME FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN Bangladesh CHALLENGE Statistics show that in Bangladesh, 10% of the population has a disability. This can be a barrier to employment due to discrimination and lack of opportunity for inclusion. M&S ACTION M&S has worked with the Centre for Rehabilitation of the Paralysed ""CRP"" in Bangladesh on the Marks and Start project since 2006. This programme supports people with disabilities to succeed in their communities through skills development training, job placement and economic empowerment. The programme generally lasts for three months, during which time candidates are trained in different areas including industrial sewing machine operations and computer office applications. After ending the training, the successful candidates receive employment from M&S supplier factories that have committed to recruit them according to their capability. IMPACT This year, 318 trainees were recruited as part of the programme. Over the past 17 years, 3,463 disadvantaged and disabled people have been employed through Marks and Start across 85 factories where we source our products.

In the past year, we have increased the number of healthier choices through new product development and reformulation - including 222 new Eat Well products and 129 new/reformulated non- HFSS (High Fat Salt Sugar) products. We have also trialled new ways of nudging customers to make healthier choices, increased the awareness of Eat Well and invested in marketing with a new multi-year partnership with the Football Association focused on Eat Well. Future target We have now set ourselves an ambitious new target to continue growing sales of healthier foods to 70% of sales tonnage by the end of 2024/25. We will continue to drive the sales of healthier products through new product development and clearer signposting, making sure our customers can make delicious, healthier choices right across the Foodhall. 2022/23 highlights Expanding our focus on healthier food This year we have updated our definition of ""healthier"" products, to capture the innovative healthier products developed outside Eat Well criteria. This definition is outlined on our corporate website and our basis of reporting document. Eat Well remains our ""gold standard"" seal of approval. The Eat Well flower is only given to products meeting evidence-based nutritional criteria, developed by our nutritionists, in consultation with the British Nutrition Foundation. Nutrient profiling All products are reviewed against the FSA (Food Standards Agency) 2004-2005 nutrient profiling model to inform product development, and we continue to reformulate products in core ranges, such as meals, deli, soft drinks and snacking to increase the proportion of our range which is non-HFSS. Currently, over half of our products are non-HFSS. Where reformulation is a challenge due to product quality, safety or integrity, we strive to ensure a healthier option is available alongside the existing product where possible.

M&S teamed up with The Institute of Grocery Distribution ""IGD"" to test what might encourage customers to make healthier choices and increase the proportion of vegetables in their shopping baskets. The 12-week trial found that dual location of certain salad items alongside Italian ready meals showed no significant uplift in sales, however the results also revealed that typical M&S shoppers' baskets already contain over a third fruit and vegetables (by weight), which is greater than the UK average. What's clear is that behaviour change and nudging is complex and evaluating impact is essential. MAS DEFENCE EATING HEALTHILY AND SUSTAINABLY M&S are proud to sell great quality, higher- welfare meat and dairy. However, we acknowledge the impact that the agricultural sector has on carbon and the need to encourage a shift towards more plant-based proteins in diets to tackle climate change. In addition to reducing the carbon footprint of meat and dairy, we are driving growth of plant-based products and investing in innovation to support new product development with meat and dairy alternatives. In 2019, we launched Plant Kitchen, with 60 items designed to meet growing consumer demand for vegan products. Our product development teams continue to innovate with sources of alternative proteins that are responsibly sourced, have excellent sustainability credentials, are nutritionally beneficial and - of course - taste delicious.

An important learning has been that non-vegan customers can see this branding as a barrier to purchase. As a result, a number of popular lines (such as plant-based milks) have moved out of Plant Kitchen branding into our core M&S food branding and, as a result, we've seen sales increase significantly. Therefore, our metric has been updated to reflect customer behaviour and ensure our convenient plant-based products are appealing and accessible to more customers.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH GOVERNANCE Our CEO is ultimately accountable for the whole sustainability programme across M&S, including our target to become a net zero business across our entire value chain by 2040, and our commitment to respect human rights. Plan A is not a separate programme but rather sits within the business with accountability for its delivery devolved to each of the Managing Directors. Oversight is provided by the Board, and our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESC) Committee. 2022/23 progress In the past financial year, we reset Plan A with a focus on becoming a net zero business across our operations and our entire value chain by 2040, a decade ahead of the government's 2050 target. This year we extended the scope of Plan A to the areas we know our customers care about: Animal welfare, Ethical trade and Healthier food. The priority for the new leadership team is to mobilise delivery of our net zero goal across the organisation. The team has injected pace and sharper focus on the programme, including net zero as one of the key workstreams within our strategic programme under the Exceptional Product, Trusted Brand pillar. ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE Strategic responsibility The scale and scope of our sustainability commitments puts them at the heart of our business operations, and they inform decisions at all levels and across all departments. Whilst our approach to sustainability starts with our exceptional product and trusted brand, it runs through all our strategic priorities to provide the foundation for our plans to reshape M&S for growth that is sustainable in every sense. We have reset the operating model and ways of working to more deeply devolve Plan A into the business with higher level of oversight. While accountability for the programme delivery remains within the businesses, responsibility for the central ESG team has moved into the remit of the Corporate Affairs Director this year. This change reflects the increased volume of environmental regulations, the strong link between ESG and corporate brand and the growing interest and engagement required across our different external and colleague stakeholder groups. ESG Business Forum During the year the existing Net Zero Steering Group was also reset as a simpler and more dynamic ESG Business Forum. The Forum brings together the accountable directors on a quarterly basis to review performance and unblock any issues and its reports are shared with Executive Committee and the ESG Committee. In particular, the model covers topics like human rights due diligence, where we expect to see growing attention from stakeholders and where strong governance is essential to the robustness of our approach.

Together, we are shaping a future where sustainability is not just a buzzword, but a fundamental pillar of our success."" Tamara Ingram Chair of the Environmental, Social & Governance Committee Review Our priority was to ensure deeper integration of our Plan A sustainability programme and to ensure the organisation moves into delivery phase for the newly agreed targets including the Group-wide goal of being a net zero business by 2040. The Committee is encouraged by how the dynamic new leadership team are driving improved performance and accelerating our pace of progress. The Committee has also continued to highlight the importance of ensuring our ESG activities, including Plan A, are understood and are able to demonstrate visible, meaningful change to our customers, colleagues and other stakeholders. The progress on reducing food waste and plastic packaging, as well as raising the bar in animal welfare standards, is particularly encouraging as we know these are issues that really matter to our customers and colleagues. During the year I visited parts of the Clothing & Home supply chain in Turkey and Bangladesh in July, and was impressed by the huge knowledge the local teams and suppliers possessed.

Upholding our standards on ethical trade Understanding the opportunities and challenges facing our Sourcing Offices and suppliers on upholding our standards on ethical trade and delivering reductions in energy, waste and water across the texile supply chain in Bangladesh and Turkey. This solidified my belief that building, maintaining and valuing long-term supplier relationships is vital as we seek to maintain our high quality credentials, drive improvements across our supply chain and tackle the challenges presented by climate change.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG COMMITTEE REVIEW CONTINUED Future focus As we move into the year ahead, the Committee agreed that a priority is to reinforce and upweight sustainability in our external messaging, so our customers actively identify M&S products, sourced and made with care and too good to waste, as a reason to shop with us. The brand reputation metric complements the established Family Matters Index and provides the brand and marketing teams with a strong platform to measure progress on sustainability-related marketing and communications. Building on the reset of Plan A last year, the new leadership team has now integrated sustainability through all the strategic priorities as a foundation for our plans to reshape M&S for growth that is sustainable in every sense.

Solutions are dependent not just on collaboration with our suppliers but also the inputs of government and wider industry stakeholders, and as a Committee we will be looking at how we can take more of a campaigning approach on topics such as reduced waste and the sequencing of national infrastructure investments. External factors will continue to present new opportunities as well as risks to our business. 6 As a Committee, we remain alert to the importance of horizon scanning so that we can better anticipate and respond to changing consumer and wider societal expectations.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ESG DATA This year, we have assessed what our customers, colleagues and investors tell us are their sustainability priorities and reviewed the sustainability reporting landscape, considering the views of our principal regulatory bodies, which support standards being developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). This has informed the reporting of our key targets and performance in the following data tables. References to specific frameworks and standards that our stakeholders consider to be most significant are provided. Most of the data and statements in this update relate to our most recent financial year (2022/23) and the previous financial year (2021/22). Where data relates to the calendar year or another period, this is clearly stated. Note that percentage change and summed total figures in this report may not align precisely to the figures provided in data tables due to rounding. Detail on how the data in this report has been prepared is in our 2023 Basis of Reporting. ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE To note, the performance updates published in this report are not performance updates against M&S Revolving Credit Facility Sustainability KPIs (information below). Revolving Credit Facility M&S has access to a Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) which was agreed in December 2021 and updated in November 2022. Under the terms of the RCF, the applicable interest rate may be adjusted each year (downward or upward) depending on whether we meet all, some or none of the targets in place across the four agreed Sustainability KPIs. ESG DATA Updated targets have now been put in place for each financial year between now and financial year 2025/26. The substance of the Sustainability KPIs remain unchanged following the November 2022 update and focus on what continue to be material emissions hotspots aligned with our net zero roadmap and which lend themselves to annual updates during the lifetime of the facility. This data is subject to a discrete assurance process scheduled to be published in autumn 2023. The Basis of Reporting document for M&S RCF Sustainability KPIs, outlining the scope and methodology, will be published alongside the performance update in autumn 2023.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG DATA ENVIRONMENT - NET ZERO (GHG EMISSIONS) ** Assured by DNV. ^Figures for previous reporting periods are restated to account for the acquisition of Gist by M&S in 2022, as well as to reflect data accuracy improvements. +In line with growth in our business our overall footprint has increased, with some of the growth offset with emissions reduction programmes we have been able to quantify. Due to the modelling approach for supply chain carbon emissions (which uses industry average benchmarks), a number of programmes that we have in place to deliver emissions reductions cannot yet be seen in our disclosed emissions. We are looking to address this through the implementation of new systems and measurement processes. Read more in How we make our products on page 23.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT GOVERNANCE ESG DATA SOCIAL INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT Marks and Spencer plc (""M&S"") commissioned DNV Business Assurance Services UK Limited (""DNV"", ""us"" or ""we"") to conduct a limited assurance engagement over Selected Information presented in the M&S Sustainability Report 2023 (the ""Report"") for the 52 weeks ended 01 April 2023. Our Conclusion: Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Selected Information is not fairly stated and has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria. This conclusion relates only to the Selected Information, and is to be read in the context of this Independent Limited Assurance Report, in particular the inherent limitations explained below. Our observations and areas for improvement will be raised in a separate report to M&S Management. Selected observations are provided below. These observations do not affect our conclusion set out above. - During the reporting period, M&S updated the governance processes for key indicators published in the Report. This included positive improvements such as quarterly reporting to senior management, and the implementation of formal internal methodology documents. We understand that M&S plans to roll this out to all indicators, and recommend this is implemented to further enhance the positive changes. - M&S introduced a digital data collection and reporting system for the energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) indicators during the reporting period. We found this system helped to streamline reporting by reducing manual inputs which reduces the risk of human error and providing some automated error checking for efficiency. Going forward M&S may wish to consider integrating other indicators such as waste reporting into the digital data collection and reporting system. - During data testing of the operational waste indicators we identified multiple errors in the aggregation of the data. For the international property indicators generated electricity from diesel and purchased electricity, we found manual input errors and inconsistent estimation methodology in the data. These were corrected prior to report publication. To reduce the risk of incorrect reporting, we recommend that additional checks are performed on the data at site level and by the central reporting team to improve its accuracy. OUR COMPETENCE, INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL DNV established policies and procedures are designed to ensure that DNV, its personnel and, where applicable, others are subject to independence requirements (including personnel of other entities of DNV) and maintain independence where required by relevant ethical requirements. This engagement work was carried out by an independent team of sustainability assurance professionals. Our multidisciplinary team consisted of professionals with a combination of environmental and sustainability assurance experience. INHERENT LIMITATIONS All assurance engagements are subject to inherent limitations as selective testing (sampling) may not detect errors, fraud or other irregularities. Non-financial data may be subject to greater inherent uncertainty than financial data, given the nature and methods used for calculating, estimating and determining such data. The selection of different, but acceptable, measurement techniques may result in different quantifications between different entities. Our assurance relies on the premise that the data and information provided to us by M&S have been provided in good faith. DNV expressly disclaims any liability or co- responsibility for any decision a person or an entity may make based on this Independent Limited Assurance Report. SELECTED INFORMATION The scope and boundary of our work is restricted to the indicators included within the Report for the 2023 reporting period (the ""Selected Information""), listed below: SCOPE 1 & SCOPE 2 GHG EMISSIONS - Direct GHG emissions from operations (Scope 1) (location-based) (ktCO2e) - Location-based indirect energy GHG emissions from operations (Scope 2) (ktCO2e) - Total Location-based Scope 1 & Scope 2 GHG emissions (ktCO2e) - Total Location-based GHG emissions per 1,000 sq. ft of salesfloor (tCO2e per 1,000 sq ft of salesfloor) - Market-based indirect energy CHC emissions from operations (ktCO2e) - Total Market-based Scope 1 & Scope 2 GHG emissions (ktCO2e) - Total Market-based GHG emissions per 1,000 sq. ft of salesfloor (tCO2e per 1,000 sq ft of salesfloor) FLEET ENERGY USE/EMISSIONS - Fuel (MWh and ktCO2e) - Refrigerant leakage (ktCO2e) UK & ROI PROPERTY ENERGY USE/EMISSIONS - Refrigerant leakage (ktCO2e only) - Gas (MWh and ktCO2e) - Heating fuel oils (MWh and ktCO2e) - LPG (MWh and ktCO2e) - District heating and cooling (MWh and ktCO2e) - Generated electricity (diesel) (MWh and ktCO2e) - Generated electricity (solar PV) (MWh and ktCO2e) - Purchased electricity (grid) (MWh and ktCO2e) Marks and Spencer Group plc Sustainability Report 2023 70",0.012876623376623375

We have not performed any work, and do not express any conclusion, on any other information that may be published in the Report or on the M&S website for the current reporting period or for previous periods STANDARD AND LEVEL OF ASSURANCE We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 revised - 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information' (revised), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. This standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance. DNV applies its own management standards and compliance policies for quality control, in accordance with ISO/IEC 17021:2015 - Conformity Assessment Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement; and the ESG DATA level of assurance obtained is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. We planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence we considered sufficient to provide a basis for our opinion, so that the risk of this conclusion being in error is reduced but not reduced to very low. BASIS OF OUR CONCLUSION We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the Selected Information; our work included, but was not restricted to: - Conducting interviews with M&S management to obtain an understanding of the key processes, systems and controls in place to generate, aggregate and report the Selected Information; - Performing limited substantive testing on a selective basis of the Selected Information to check that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported; For the ""RSPO Certified Sustainable Palm Oil with Segregated status (% of all palm oil)"" indicator the source evidence checked was the RSPO certification held by the palm oil suppliers provided by M&S' third party consultant. - Reviewing that the evidence, measurements and their scope provided to us by M&S for the Selected Information is prepared in line with the Criteria; - Assessing the appropriateness of the Criteria for the Selected Information; and - Reading the Report and narrative accompanying the Selected Information within it with regard to the Criteria. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS OF M&S AND DNV The Directors of M&S have sole responsibility for: - Preparing and presenting the Selected information in accordance with the Criteria; - Designing, implementing and maintaining effective internal controls over the information and data, resulting in the preparation of the Selected Information that is free from material misstatements; - Measuring and reporting the Selected Information based on their established Criteria; and - Contents and statements contained within the Report and the Criteria. Our responsibility is to plan and perform our work to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected Information has been prepared in accordance with the Criteria and to report to M&S in the form of an independent limited assurance conclusion, based on the work performed and the evidence obtained. We have not been responsible for the preparation of the Report.

"OUR ESG STRATEGY GOVERNANCE ESG DATA PERFORMANCE SUMMARY ENVIRONMENT CEO INTRODUCTION KERY “ WE WANT TO BE THE MOST TRUSTED RETAILER, DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR CUSTOMERS, WITH QUALITY PRODUCTS AT THE HEART OF EVERYTHING WE DO. STUART MACHIN Chief Executive Officer SOCIAL Over the last year we have reset our purpose and vision so we are clear why we exist, who we are and where we are going. We want to be the most trusted retailer, doing the right thing for customers, with quality products at the heart of everything we do. It's a bold vision, but it gets to the heart of what sets M&S apart. It's why, when I joined the business, I talked about the need to modernise the business but always protect the magic of M&S. The magic that comes from our heritage of exceptional quality, value, service and innovation; delivered through our deep supplier partnerships, and the lengths that we go to. The magic that means our customers trust us to always source and make products with care, treat our colleagues, growers and farmers well, and help them look after the precious resources we need to serve customers today, and in the future. Plan A - how we express our commitment to sustainability - is therefore core to our vision and purpose, and integral to our trusted value proposition. A great example of this is how we source, make and sell milk in our Food business. We are the only retailer who can say all of the milk we sell, coming from 40 dedicated Select Dairy Farmers, is RSPCA Assured - as part of our market-leading approach to animal welfare. We were first to market in setting up a milk pool, meaning we have paid farmers a fair price for their milk based on their cost of production, for 25 years. Last year we were the first retailer to offer ""best before"" labelling on fully recyclable milk bottles, following the removal of coloured plastic caps, helping customers to tackle food waste and play their part in a circular economy - two key areas where customers want to make an impact. Just a few months ago, we announced a flm investment with our supplier partners to alter the diet of our pasture-grazed cows which will remove a projected 11,000 tonnes of GHG emissions annually - reducing our fresh milk carbon tonnes footprint by 8.4%. In our Clothing & Home business, I saw first-hand just how much care our clothing suppliers take when sourcing and making our garments when I visited Sri Lanka. From innovating to use recycled polyester and new dyeing techniques that use less chemicals and water, to supporting those who find it hardest to get into work through Marks & Start, they are doing fantastic work. It was brilliant to see the way we are working in partnership with our suppliers to reduce our environmental impact and improve livelihoods.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR ESG STRATEGY GOVERNANCE ESG DATA OUR ESG STRATEGY ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES ARE SUPPORTED AND ENHANCED BY OUR ESG STRATEGY From the very beginning, M&S has built trust by doing the right thing by our colleagues, customers and the communities which we serve. This remains the case today - 140 years later - and we express this commitment through our vision to be the most trusted brand, doing the right thing for our customers, with exceptional quality products at the heart of everything we do. Our approach to ESG - which we badge Plan A - underpins our vision and is our promise to always source and make our products with care, so customers can trust us to do the right thing. It is also an integral enabler of our strategy to Reshape M&S for sustainable, profitable Growth so that we become a net zero business across our value chain by 2040 and conserve the precious resources our business relies on. Delivery of our ESG strategy and Plan A is embedded across our nine strategic priorities and through our business-unit led operating model.

Our biggest environmental commitment and challenge is to become a net zero business across our entire value chain by 2040. Six per cent of our emissions are Scope 1 & 2 emissions that sit within our own operations and our operational efficiencies section outlines how we are reducing these emissions. The remaining 94% are Scope 3 emissions, that sit within our supply chain. To reduce these emissions, we will need to change the way we operate our business, how we source and how we make our products. This report provides an update on our activity and progress on our journey to net zero, including: - Healthier food - helping our customers make healthier choices when they buy our food. - People - creating a high performing culture where everyone can be themselves and be their best. - Community - using the power of our brand to champion good causes with charity partners and taking an active role in our communities. GOVERNANCE Good governance is at the core of how we do business. We expect every colleague to play their part through living our behaviour to ""act selflessly"" - always acting in the best long-term interests of M&S and respecting their colleagues and our customers so we can win together - and by doing the right thing through compliance with our policies and standards. - Responsible sourcing - sourcing responsibly to mitigate our impact on the environment and protecting biodiversity and nature (Scope 3 emissions). - Sustainable manufacturing - collaborating with supply chain partners to tackle environmental issues (Scope 3 emissions). - Waste & circularity - designing products that are simply too good to waste, and using innovation to improve resource use (Scope 3 emissions). - Operational efficiencies - investing to reduce energy usage in our stores and logistics network (Scope 1 & 2 emissions). PRIORITISING MATERIAL ISSUES Assessing the priorities of our ESG strategy and disclosures is based on data and impact, so that we focus on the environmental and social issues our stakeholders are most concerned with. The process of engagement with stakeholders is a continuous one, starting primarily with our customers through our ESG Reputation Tracker, and with our colleagues via ""Straight to Stuart"", our colleague feedback portal. SOCIAL As a product-led business, sourcing and making our products with care is at the heart of how we deliver exceptional product so customers can trust us to do the right thing. This report provides an update on our activity and progress over 2023/24, including: We also engage a wide and diverse group of organisations and experts, including supply chain partners, investors, policy- makers and campaigners. The rich mix of feedback and views helps us aim higher in balancing different and sometimes competing expectations. - Animal welfare - continuing to be number one in upholding the welfare of animals. - Ethical trade - raising supply chain standards to improve working conditions Marks and Spencer Group plc ESG Report 2024 8",0.20937003968253964
"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG DATA OUR ESG STRATEGY NET ZERO TARGETS NEAR-TERM (<3 YEARS) Target reduction in carbon emissions by 2025/26 against 2016/17 baseline (restated). 2023/24 34% (1.9m tonne) progress 72% NET ZERO pathway identified MEDIUM-TERM (3-10 YEARS) Target 55% reduction in carbon emissions by 2029/30 against 2016/17 baseline. LONG-TERM (>10 YEARS) Target Net zero across entire value chain by 2039/40. ENVIRONMENT Plan A was launched in 2007 and reset in 2021 to focus more tightly on our commitment to being a net zero business across our entire value chain by 2040. OUR EMISSIONS Our Scope 1 & 2 emissions make up 6% of our total emissions and come from the fuel, gas and electricity used in our stores and logistics operations. We have reduced these emissions by 33% since 2016/171. The majority of our carbon footprint though is upstream and downstream of our direct operations, classified as Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These make up 94% of our total footprint, with the majority of Scope 3 emissions coming from the products we purchase to sell through our Food and Clothing & Home businesses. This year, we have restated our 2016/17 baseline and our 2022/23 inventory with improved data providing a more granular Scope 3 emissions number. Due to the complexity of gathering and calculating these emissions, going forward we will continue to report our Scope 3 emissions a year in arrears for improved accuracy and reliability. The graph to the right shows the restatement of our emissions for 2016/17 and 2022/23. The key change to our emissions data was driven by improved calculations on the purchased goods in our Clothing & Home business.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR ESG STRATEGY SOCIAL GOVERNANCE NET ZERO CONTINUED LOTS DONE - PROGRESS FOR 2023/24 We have been able to calculate realised GHG emissions savings of 447,000 tCO,e since 2016/17 through our focus on 10 net zero priority areas and we have now identified a pathway of emissions reduction for 72% of our 2025/26 target, an increase from 62% last year. On an ongoing basis we will continue to review and improve our data and reporting on our carbon emissions to reflect business change, the evolution of carbon measurement techniques and guidance and the impact of emerging technologies. Driving innovation through our Plan A Accelerator Fund In 2022, we launched our flm ""Plan A Accelerator Fund"" to fund or co-fund projects that address challenges and support innovation that will help us reduce emissions. This year we have worked with our long-term supply chain partners to focus on key areas where we're well placed to make a difference. We funded projects this year that pilot innovative modern technologies, drive carbon reduction, and deliver outputs and lessons that can be scaled and are shareable with our broader supply chain. We addressed areas including: Energy: Producing green hydrogen through electrolysis technology using wind or solar power generated on farms to replace fossil fuels, and pasteurisation using heat pumps and renewable electricity. Recycling: Introducing Polytag technology on Food products to better understand how much, when and where our branded single- use plastic is recycled in UK recycling centres. In our Clothing & Home business, we are piloting the viability of an end-of-life recycling solution for footwear. ENVIRONMENT Technology: Using new agricultural technology to produce a field of net zero root crops, which includes using low carbon fertilisers and autonomous farm vehicles and drones. Also using AI technology to improve energy management in store operations and distribution centres. Water: Applying innovative solutions to water in irrigation systems such as nanobubble technology (water with increased oxygen) and organic components, to conserve water resources in the production of fruits and brassicas in water-scarce regions. “ By turning our obsession with innovation towards climate change, and tapping into the entrepreneurial spirit of our suppliers, we can turbo charge our drive to be a net zero business across all our operations and entire supply chain by 2040. STUART MACHIN Chief Executive Officer ESG DATA UNDERSTANDING OUR CLOTHING & HOME product footprint In 2023, we worked with South Pole, an external climate consultant, to calculate Scope 3 carbon emissions from manufacturing our Clothing & Home products across our supply chain tiers - from raw material selection, to fabric processing and product manufacturing.

Throughout our supply chain we will continue to focus on improving how we collect and report on emissions as well as prioritise innovation and collaboration in order to identify further emissions reduction opportunities. This will include understanding the results of our already approved Plan A Accelerator Fund projects, rolling them out more broadly if successful and promoting new submissions from our supply chain partners. We will also work towards a Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) - aligned transition plan to ensure we have a detailed roadmap for our own net zero target and the transition to a low-carbon economy. 1 Forests, Land and Agriculture - Science Based Targets and Land Sector and Removals Guidance | GHG Protocol MEASURING EMISSIONS REDUCTION We are improving how we gather data to calculate our overall emissions. For our Scope 1 & 2 emissions, we use Sphera to collect and collate our emissions. For our Scope 3 emissions, by collaborating with industry partners such as Manufacture 2030 and Higg Index, we are accessing more supplier data so we can have a better understanding of our emissions hotspots. South Pole assisted with our Clothing & Home products, and Mondra is used in our Food business to provide product level emissions. As we build on our emissions methodology, we will continue to encounter challenges in having a comparable baseline year for setting targets. As highlighted on page 10, we will be transparent on how changes impact our targets. Read more on page 10 TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION We know a lot of emissions reductions across our supply chain are reliant on improved technology and innovation. Through our Plan A Accelerator Fund, we support innovation with our suppliers and partners in the textile, agricultural and logistics industries, and promote emissions reduction in our supply chains. Read more on page 12 The transition to net zero is not straightforward. We believe it is important to acknowledge the challenges and continue to drive efforts to collaborate and innovate to overcome obstacles. POLICIES AND INCENTIVES Reaching net zero will require the right support and policy frameworks from governments. We want to see a net zero pathway published, that shifts away from the sole focus on reporting, and assists with making investment decisions, and includes specific strategies for transitioning to a more sustainable logistics network, supporting more circular products and greener energy. In the UK, we will continue to work collaboratively with sector partners, such as the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) and the British Retail Consortium (BRC), to clarify what coordination, support and incentives are required across industry as we work towards net zero.

This means that sustainable palm oil from certified sources is kept separately from non-sustainable palm oil throughout the supply chain and does not contribute to deforestation or biodiversity loss2. We're proud to see our work on sustainable palm oil recognised as we were ranked as ""Leading the Way"" in the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Palm Buyers 2024 Scorecard and received top marks in the RSPO Shared Responsibility 2023 Scorecard. 1 Includes transitional mechanisms such as mass balance, area mass balance and RTRS regional credits. 2 The remaining 2% are palm oil derivatives and fractions where sourcing RSPO-segregated materials is an industry-wide challenge. 3 Significant food suppliers that procure from M&S Select Livestock or Aquaculture Farms, supply M&S with products, or supply animal protein products as ingredients to direct suppliers of M&S. SOCIAL GOVERNANCE Soy Soy is a globally traded commodity and a significant source of animal feed protein. However, due to agricultural expansion to meet demand, soy is contributing to global deforestation and land-use change. Given the UK represents only around 1% of global demand, a collaborative industry approach is required to ensure that all of the soy in our suppliers' animal and aquaculture feed is from verified deforestation- and conversion-free (vDCF) supply chains by 2025. We have made considerable progress in our responsible sourcing of soy having now achieved 66% verified deforestation and conversion free soy1 in the year ending 2023/24 (2022/23: 39%). In 2023/24, we updated our Animal Feed Policy to clarify our expectations for M&S key suppliers and manufacturers3, requesting they increase their uptake of certified soy that can be evidenced to support the transition to vDCF by the UK Soy Manifesto. Cocoa The cocoa industry faces significant challenges, including the inequality of cocoa farmers' pay, which can make it difficult for farmers to FOREVER Sabah In addition to sourcing RSPO certified palm oil we extend our commitment beyond our direct supply chains by partnering with Forever Sabah, a non-profit organisation, where we have supported the audit and successful RSPO certification of smallholders in Malaysia.

Due to unique challenges in the region, we are working together on an innovative new regional approach in Assam that provides a pathway towards certification and the long-term supply of Fairtrade tea. This means we remain dedicated to paying the Fairtrade Premium and Minimum Price as part of our commitment to a fair future for workers in Assam, the supply of this core ingredient, and our 100% Fairtrade tea commitment. The EU Deforestation Regulation comes into effect this year (with the draft UK Forest Risk Commodities legislation to be determined), which will drive the requirement for market- wide solutions to sourcing zero- deforestation commodities and support us in achieving our targets. For soy, we are continuing to collaborate with industry groups to advocate for market-level solutions to deliver higher volumes of vDCF soy to the UK. We are also committed to maintaining all of the palm oil and palm-based ingredients in our own-brand food products certified to sustainable standards set by the RSPO.

LOW-IMPACT FARMING NET ZERO We support all our farmers, particularly British farmers, to grow lower-carbon and responsibly produced food, using less pesticide with fewer types, enhance their soil health and fertility, protect natural resources and drive innovation. LOTS DONE - PROGRESS FOR 2023/24 Supporting British farming Over 70% of the emissions in our Food business come from primary agriculture and of these emissions, the majority come from the production of meat. Partnering with over 16,000 M&S Select Farmers to help them reduce their environmental impact and increase their resilience in the face of increasing climate-related challenges is a priority. There is growing acknowledgement of the role that animals can play in ""regenerative"" farming systems and in restoring soil health. Our approach is to decarbonise our meat and milk through working with our UK farmers on new production models and driving on-farm innovation. Our Pathway Beef, for example, already has a carbon footprint 40% lower than the UK's average and we have developed plans with our suppliers to reduce carbon right across our meat supply chain. Farming with Nature Biodiversity is vital for productive and resilient farming systems, and we cannot deliver net zero without it. Our Farming with Nature programme supports the uptake of nature-friendly farming practices, and long-term climate resilience across all of our British grower base, protecting and enhancing 10,000 hectares of habitat for wildlife. SOCIAL Since 2021 we have partnered with LEAF (Linking Environment and Farming) to help us deliver our Farming with Nature standards: we require all of our British growers to be LEAF (Linking Environment and Farming) Marque certified, plus complete two additional M&S-specific modules, focused on landscape & nature and integrated pest management. Uptake of our modules has been strong: our British Select Farmers have met the majority of the practices (90% of landscape and nature and 88% of integrated pest management practices) in 2023/24. One example of the high standards our growers meet is all our growers set aside on average 8% of their land to wildlife. This year we were pleased to have received recognition from the 2023 WWF Basket assessment; M&S was the only retailer to score 100% against the robust environmental schemes metric for our Farming with Nature standards. This year we started to scale successful interventions and biodiversity and soil measurement technologies from the five science-based biodiversity monitoring trials we have been working on in partnership with the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust and Fera Science. This included funding and implementing Agrisound sensors across 18 farms, covering 120 habitats and over 1,000 hectares.

This year we made progress, moving from 68% to 76% for responsibly sourced fibres. While we did a lot of this through our in-house expertise, our supply chain is global and very complex, so we work with partners, such as Textile Exchange (a global non-profit who aim to drive impact through the fashion, textile and apparel industry) and the CanopyStyle initiative, (who work with fashion brands, retailers, designers and viscose producers to protect ancient and endangered forests) to incorporate best sustainable practices in the fashion and textile industries. Our focus for sustainable raw materials is on our core materials: cotton, MMCF and polyester, which together represent more than 80% of our fibre mix. The preferred raw material alternatives have a lower environmental impact than their traditional equivalents and consider various aspects of sustainability (such as farming practices, renewable resources use and deforestation risk) based on industry-recognised data. Our Sustainability Academy supports colleagues to drive change through raw material selection. SOCIAL Cotton Over half of our raw materials mix is cotton.

We joined as a pioneer member back in 2009 and since then, we have supported Better Cotton's mission to help cotton communities survive and thrive, while protecting and restoring the environment. With over one fifth of the world's cotton now grown under the Better Cotton standard, we believe it is the right time to work with our supply chain to embed traceability requirements in how this cotton is traded within the industry. Since 2021, we have been working with Better Cotton and other brand members through the Traceability Panel, to set up the basis of traceability for Better Cotton. In 2023/24, we ran a pilot in our Indian supply chain to trace Better Cotton from its region of origin up to each stage of its transformation process and into our UK stores. The traceability journey started at the ginner (when cotton fibre is separated from the seeds) close to the fields in Maharashtra; to the northern region of Himachal Pradesh for spinning; garment manufacturing in Delhi; and finally, our stores in the UK. This project gave us invaluable learnings on all suppliers' perspectives and input on how to scale Better Cotton traceability throughout our supply chain, and we have shared our feedback with the Traceability Panel. With this successful first pilot, we are now preparing our supply chain and extending our mapping exercise to facilitate scaling traceable Better Cotton in the future, and progressively onboard more suppliers to this new chain of custody model.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR ESG STRATEGY GOVERNANCE ESG DATA ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL SUSTAINABLE MANUFACTURING CONTINUED In 2023/24, we focused on improving our understanding of assessment metrics among our suppliers through training and engagement. We provided in-person training for over 350 facilities in five of our main manufacturing countries. Our regional sustainability teams also engaged directly with key supply chain partners to evaluate their responses, check data accuracy and use the assessment insights to develop facility improvement plans. LOTS TO DO, LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY - FOCUS FOR 2024/25 This year, our focus is to use the data we are receiving through the Higg FEM to work with suppliers on action plans so they can progress towards their reduction targets. We will engage more suppliers with the Apparel Impact Institute's (Aii) Carbon Leadership Programme. REDUCING SUPPLIER emissions Access to Apparel Impact Institute's (Aii) Carbon Leadership Programme is a key part of our supplier engagement, focused on high-volume facilities. The programme can help deliver an average 30% reduction in facility emissions on completion. The programme involves an in-depth carbon assessment, identifying carbon reduction opportunities and undertaking carbon reduction target setting. An action plan will focus on applying technical solutions to accelerate decarbonisation through engineering works, which improve energy efficiency, reduce heat loss and promote heat recovery. Supply chain partners will also gain a better understanding of where it is feasible to convert to lower carbon fuels and access renewable energy. 50 of our top volume fabric suppliers are already engaged and benefitting from this programme. UPSKILLING COLLEAGUES THROUGH OUR Sustainability Academy The Sustainability Academy is a training programme aimed at improving Clothing & Home colleagues' understanding of M&S sustainability goals and ethical trade standards. This provides a deeper understanding of the context beyond our policies. It equips colleagues with the knowledge and tools needed to improve engagement internally and support their decision- making process. This includes offering an in-depth session on: - An introduction into circular design, standards and certification. - Sustainable manufacturing and the environmental impacts of manufacturing textiles (in particular supporting suppliers to help them reduce emissions and improve on chemical management). - Ethical trade modules outlining the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and M&S' approach to responsible sourcing (including policies, factory auditing, monitoring and worker impact programmes). - Our core raw materials (cotton, polyester and MMCF, animal-derived fibres). This year, 133 colleagues from across our product teams attended the training. M Marks and Spencer Group plc ESG Report 2024 22",0.12551892551892554
"GOVERNANCE PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR ESG STRATEGY ENVIRONMENT WASTE & CIRCULARITY Resources are limited so at M&S our approach is to prevent, remove, reduce and recycle and we put that into place as much as we can across our supply chain. Packaging plays a key role across M&S and reducing packaging and minimising all forms of waste, including food waste, is a top priority for M&S and our customers. We are constantly thinking of ways to reduce plastic as well as being efficient and minimising the waste we produce. We are also cognisant of forthcoming regulation which will have an impact on what we choose to do as a business versus what we do as part of our regulatory requirements. TARGETS FOOD WASTE Target 2023/24 progress Food waste reduced by 50% by 2030 against 2017/18 baseline. 44% FOOD REDISTRIBUTION Target 2023/24 100% of edible progress surplus food be redistributed by 2025. 85% FOOD NET ZERO NET ZERO SOCIAL FOOD FOOD LOTS DONE - PROGRESS FOR 2023/24 Plastic reduction Packaging is fundamental to delivering our products to customers with the quality they expect from M&S. We continue to innovate with new programmes to reduce plastic across our stores and provide circular packaging systems, as well as protecting food so that as much of it as possible goes for human consumption. Of course, it is essential to protect product and reduce waste which can have a bigger carbon impact than the packaging itself. In 2022/23, we set an ambitious target to remove 1bn units of plastic across our food hall by 2027/28 (from 2017/18). WE HAVE REMOVED 399m plastic units since 2017/18. We set a target to remove another 75m units of plastic in 2023/24, as part of our overall 2027/28 target, which we have exceeded by removing 144m units. Key initiatives in 2023/24 include: - Replacing plastic carrier bags with paper bags. - Replacing plastic with paper or card in our biscuits range. - Moving our rice and grains range from plastic to paper packaging, which is fully recyclable at home. - Replacing plastic pads with paper in selected berries, rolling out our cardboard punnet across top-tier tomatoes, and rolling out reduced-plastic alternatives for avocados, citrus, kiwis and mushrooms. ESG DATA Soft plastics collection Where possible, we design our packaging for recycling at home. However, some materials have no household recyclable alternative yet, and are necessary to protect the product to maintain freshness, quality and shelf life. Most UK household recycling collections cannot accept soft plastics as part of kerbside recycling. We provide collection bins in over 500 stores for our customers to deposit any brand of soft plastic and avoid putting more plastic into general waste. This material is then sorted into different plastic polymers and is used to make PlastEcoWood products, including items such as picnic benches and planters, which we donate to schools and community centres. So far, we have donated 49 items to worthy causes. Reducing food waste While our food waste marginally grew this year, we remain on track to meet our 50% target and we have improved edible surplus redistribution. 85% of edible surplus is redistributed - up from 79% in 2022/23 - with some stores consistently hitting over 90% each week in 2023/24 which has also helped us reduce the food we send to anaerobic digestion. Actions we have taken this year to reduce our waste in stores include improvements to ordering and allocation systems. Additionally, we provided freezers to a further 120 stores and over 70% of our stores can now repurpose in-store bakery bread as frozen garlic bread products. As 60% of the UK's food waste comes from our homes, it is crucial we help our customers waste less food at home. We are collaborating with the NGO WRAP, and other retailers on various food waste initiatives, including moving milk date codes from Use By to Best Before, removing date codes on vegetables and allowing customers to use their judgement on whether products are still fresh to eat. We are also simplifying our labelling instructions on storage, open life statements and freezing. Marks and Spencer Group plc ESC Report 2024 23",0.02529284441049147
"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY ENVIRONMENT ESG DATA OUR ESG STRATEGY WASTE & CIRCULARITY CONTINUED GROUNDBREAKING RESEARCH ON difficult plastics As part of our mission to advance recycling for difficult plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film, we are collaborating with The University of Portsmouth and its Centre for Enzyme Innovation team. Together, we are researching the potential of applying enzymatic recycling techniques to hard-to-recycle plastics. Our groundbreaking research has found that the technology can be applied to PET film, so it breaks it down into monomers which could then be rebuilt to create a closed-loop material. In 2024/25, we are looking to gain a greater understanding of how this process works on the different types of PET film used in our packaging.

Customers can choose from 10 own-brand homecare products, including cleaning sprays, laundry detergents, fabric conditioners and washing- up liquids. Over 10,000 customers have engaged with the scheme to date. Coffee cups This year, we became the first retailer to roll-out a fully recyclable paper fibre cup and lid across our Cafés. Plastic lining in conventional takeaway cups means they cannot be easily recycled and M&S' new cups and lids are made from 100% paper and certified plastic free which can be recycled in household and on the go. This change will remove over 20m units of plastic from our food business. LOTS TO DO, LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY - FOCUS FOR 2024/25 We are developing a way to recycle the residual material from our soft plastics collection into products that we aim to sell in store.

We participate in monthly working groups with other members, which focus on circularity, closing the loop and improving data management to drive action. Product design Durability is a fundamental aspect of our circular design principles. From inception to production, we craft our items to meet our high durability standards, with versatile fits, easy-to-care-for fabrics and detailed care instructions, for example the ""let me down"" hems on our schoolwear. Remove, reduce, recycle We are innovating to reduce packaging and convert as many single-use plastic items (such as stickers) as possible to paper, collaborating with suppliers on solutions that also maintain product quality. In 2023/24, our Reuse and Recycling Programme prevented 85m hangers going to landfill. Through our Closed-Loop Hanger Recycling Programme, we ask customers to leave hangers in store. We then send the hangers to a reuse centre, where they are sorted and forwarded to garment suppliers for reuse. Damaged hangers are recycled and made into new hangers. In 2023/24, we switched our hanger recycled material to polypropylene to increase its durability. In June 2023, M&S Beauty launched its take-back scheme in partnership with Handle Recycling. Handle specialises in recycling beauty packaging and transforming it into sellable products and accessories. ESG DATA The accessories they make from the collected waste can then be recycled again with Handle at the end of life through our in-store collection boxes. Since June 2023, we have diverted over 1.5 tonnes of beauty waste that would have otherwise ended up in landfill, been incinerated or worse still lost in ""the system"" due to contamination, complexity of materials/components, size and colour of the materials. From the material we have collected since the scheme began, we are developing a comb made with ~98% (the remaining ~2% is the masterbatch that will be added to give the comb its colour) beauty packaging waste from M&S. The comb will be available in stores from October 2024, and we are hoping it's the first in a line of recycled accessories made from M&S Beauty waste packaging. Take-back and resale Our UK customers have given new life to over 36m items of clothing through the Shwopping Programme since its launch in 2008, raising an estimated £23m for Oxfam. In 2023/24, we expanded our longstanding Shwopping Partnership with Oxfam for the Back-to-School season with dedicated pre-loved school uniform Shwop boxes in over 200 stores across the UK. This scheme encouraged customers to Shwop old school uniform for a 20% off voucher on selected kids clothing with their Sparks card. The campaign generated over 5,200 QR code scans with over 1,500 customers going on to redeem the deal. 517kg of product was donated with 270kg going on to be in a sellable condition.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR ESG STRATEGY ENVIRONMENT GOVERNANCE ESG DATA WASTE & CIRCULARITY CONTINUED LOTS TO DO, LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY- FOCUS FOR 2024/25 This year in partnership with Oxfam, M&S is running a new trial which asks customers to give their unwearable clothes a second chance at life by donating them alongside their pre-loved wearable clothing. The new online trial will allow M&S customers to order a free postal donation bag, made from 100% recycled plastic, straight to their doorstep. Customers can then place their pre-loved second-hand clothing inside the bag - separating between those that are wearable from unwearable - but equally too good to waste. This means clothing which can't be worn anymore because it is torn, stained, stretched or broken can have a second chance of life and be used for other means. Both Oxfam and M&S are working to support the ACT ""Textile Waste Project"", which is led by the UK Fashion and Textile Association. SOCIAL CIRCULAR DESIGN PRINCIPLES TRAINING AND CSF partnership We have continued our collaboration with the Centre for Sustainable Fashion (CSF), a University of the Arts London research centre based at London College of Fashion. Through our partnership with CSF, we have run training workshops to help our product teams navigate complex circularity concepts, such as extending garment lifetimes, recyclability, lower-impact materials, and design techniques. Starting with outerwear, bras and jersey tops, we extended our programme in 2023/24 to offer mentorship to all product categories. Throughout 2023/24, we held mentoring sessions for our Design and Technology teams, providing an opportunity to share learnings about textile circularity challenges. CAPTURING SUPPLY CHAIN waste We are collaborating with Reverse Resources, an online platform that matches textile waste at factory to textile recyclers. In 2023/24, we undertook a baseline assessment to map and analyse the textile waste of more than 40 Tier 1 suppliers in Bangladesh, China, India and Türkiye. Through this project we gained more of an understanding of our production waste, and it helped us identify potential opportunities to consolidate different streams of pre-consumer textile waste and optimise the way they are collected and processed. The next steps for us will be to maximise the recycling potential of nominated production sites, trial new connections with recyclers and support the growth of textile-to-textile recycling on a wider scale. -----...... .... .. ...

NET ZERO As a result, we have made good progress in reducing Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions across our UK and Republic of Ireland (ROI) property estate in the last 12 months, despite an increase in grid carbon intensity this year. The main drivers have been the further roll-out of LED lighting, voltage optimisation, controls and introduction of fridge doors. These initiatives have driven cost savings, carbon reduction and energy efficiency. We have reduced our annual energy use by 3% (24m kWh), which has resulted in the removal of 6,000 tCO2e from our estate. 3% Reduction in energy usage across UK & ROI property estate UK & ROI PROPERTY ESTATE LOTS DONE - PROGRESS FOR 2023/24 In conjunction with CBRE, we mapped our carbon emissions on a store-by-store basis which allows us to make targeted decisions to efficiently drive carbon reductions. This year, our efforts have focused on: Measurement Using Sphera to capture and report data, we have been able to make targeted efficiency decisions on a store-by-store basis. Over the last year we have been able to closely track the effect store rotation is having on carbon reduction. In 2023/24, store rotation contributed to a full year reduction of 1,850 tCO2e. We will continue to align store rotation to our plans to roll-out initiatives, reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions from the estate. Targeted action Based on Sphera data, and working with external consultants, we have made improvements in store energy efficiency by targeting the in-store environment. This includes installing energy-efficient fridge doors in 30 of our Foodhalls to help regulate internal temperatures, which is expected to deliver 20-30% energy savings per store, per year. Driving efficiencies across the estate Over 2023/24, we invested in LED lighting to cover 76% of our stores, voltage optimisation and store controls, which has reduced emissions by 2,300 tCO,e and improved operational efficiencies. ESG DATA This year we reviewed our trading lighting requirements following feedback through our colleague suggestion programme, ""Straight to Stuart"", This lead to a saving of 1.8m kWh in energy consumption across the year. Rotation to newer stores For all new stores, we have developed a standard specification for energy efficiency, so that we continuously improve the store estate as older stores are rotated. The specifications include stores being 100% electric power (no gas) and full LED lighting. Each store will have the ability to control electricity usage remotely and have voltage optimisation for incoming energy. Finally, there will be electric vehicle charging provisions for both rapid and ultra-fast charging.

ESG DATA DEFORESTATION-FREE leather In June 2023, we were among the first retail brands to commit to source bovine leather from a deforestation-free supply chain by 2030, and signed the Deforestation-Free Call to Action for Leather, in partnership with our partners Textile Exchange, the Leather Working Group (LWG) and WWF. The global leather supply chain is complex, but through industry-wide collaboration, we aim to build traceability at scale, and together identify and address issues related to deforestation. Over 2023/24, we worked with third-party partners to assess risks and develop a tailored action plan to meet this 2030 commitment.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY GOVERNANCE ESG DATA OUR ESG STRATEGY ETHICAL TRADE OUR COMMITMENT Our mission to deliver exceptional products as a trusted brand goes together with doing the right thing. This means treating everyone fairly and with respect, and taking a zero- tolerance stance on discrimination and unacceptable behaviour. We have responsibilities to identify, prevent, mitigate and remediate human rights risks, ensuring we treat supply chain partners fairly and as partners in our success. Global economic difficulties, devaluation of currencies, financial and political crises, and high inflation have had a direct impact on our supply chains, but our strong supplier relationships, collaboration and implementation of industry initiatives mean we have been able to support factories and workers through these challenging times. Regional issues include minimum wage reviews in Bangladesh leading to unrest and factory closures, and humanitarian crises in the aftermath of the earthquake in Türkiye resulting in labour shortages. ENVIRONMENT We work collaboratively to address systematic issues such as wages, as well as through our supply chain partners to address local issues, such as working conditions. We also seek to enhance the lives of the people in our supply chain through targeted programmes aligned to our salient issues.

We are committed to respecting internationally recognised human rights and the principles and guidance in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). We also support the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We continually review and improve our practices to ensure we are upholding our standards and respecting the human rights of the people behind our products. Our salient human rights issues We operate in a diverse range of geographies, consumer cultures and regulatory environments. It is important we understand where our operations and sourcing impact adversely on individuals, so we can prioritise our efforts in these areas.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY ESG DATA OUR ESG STRATEGY ENVIRONMENT ETHICAL TRADE CONTINUED CLOTHING & HOME C&H Health and safety OUR APPROACH In Clothing & Home, our approach to ethical sourcing is based on robust risk assessment. Through our ethical compliance monitoring programme, approved independent third-party companies ethically audit our suppliers' factories every year against our Global Sourcing Principles and international standards. Our specialist local sourcing office Compliance teams in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, India, Sri Lanka, Türkiye and Vietnam manage the ethical compliance monitoring programme, including grading, escalation and audit follow-up activity. We expect our suppliers to address any non-compliance and implement remediation plans. We pair our compliance monitoring with worker impact projects to address our salient issues and create positive change for workers. We also collaborate with relevant stakeholders to use our combined influence to maximise that change. M&S is a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), RISE (Reimagining Industry to Support Equality) and the International Labor Organisation (ILO) Better Work Programme. LOTS DONE - PROGRESS FOR 2023/24 - Implemented our due diligence programme for our Tier 2 suppliers, through a combination of third-party audits/assessments and M&S ethical compliance visits. - Commissioned research and investigations into key salient risks to identify opportunities to strengthen our policies and processes. - Launched the Everyone's Business app, so M&S colleagues can participate in factory due diligence and report visit observations remotely. - Continued capacity building programmes throughout our supply chain. OUR SALIENT ISSUES Our Global Sourcing Principles set clear requirements that supply chain partners must provide a healthy, safe and clean workplace for all workers. - As part of our ongoing commitment to working conditions in our supply base, we were a signatory of the original Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh (2013), which aimed for sustainable improvements to working conditions in the Bangladesh garment industry. We have since signed the subsequent Transition Accord (2018), the Interim Agreement (2021), the International Accord for Health and Safety in the Textile and Garment Industry (2021, 2023) and the Pakistan Accord on Health and Safety in the Textile and Garment Industry (2023). - In 2023/24 we supported a supplier factory in China to implement the HERhealth project. The project ran for 18 months, training 30 peer health educators, who then provided women's health education for female workers, including on family planning, mental health, nutrition and exercise. This programme reached over 700 workers. - In 2023/24 in Cambodia, five of our factories participated in the Commuting Safety for Cambodian Workers programme, funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID). This project focused on improving commuting safety for Cambodian workers through stakeholder collaboration, training and best-practice sharing, factory road safety working groups, and engagement with trade unions and driver associations. SOCIAL GOVERNANCE Discrimination and women's rights We are committed to inclusion and diversity and believe everyone should feel comfortable to come to work and be themselves. We have a zero tolerance stance on discrimination and unacceptable behaviour.

Freedom of association, i.e. the right of workers and employers to form and join organisations of their own choosing, is an integral part of a free and open society. Workers' rights to freedom of association must be respected. We promote workplace representation by: - including information on our interactive map, for transparency where suppliers have a worker committee and/or trade union. - verification during our ethical compliance monitoring programme. - engaging with external stakeholders, including unions, on a case-by-case basis if allegations/issues are raised relating to freedom of association, to resolve issues with the factory. FOOD FOOD OUR APPROACH Our most salient issues in Foods mirror those in Clothing & Home (see Figure on page 36), but can look different in practice given the nature of the food supply chain. We structure our Food human rights strategy in two parts, to protect workers in our supply chains from potential risk and to enhance livelihoods in key global supply chains: - Protect - ensuring we have a robust compliance programme with Tier 1 suppliers and working on challenging industry-wide issues, such as modern slavery. - Enhance - developing programmes to build livelihoods in our supply chain, through which we can engage customers on issues they care about.

In 2023, we also retained our No. 1 position in UK retail for Fairtrade tea and coffee, with a 31% UK retailer market share of all Fairtrade coffee and 48% of Fairtrade tea. £1.73m of our Fairtrade premium was from sales of M&S Fairtrade tea and coffee alone. We have continued to support Fairtrade in developing an innovative approach for Assamese tea to address specific challenges in the region. C Further detail is available here We were also the first UK retailer to fund the Fairtrade Child Labour Prevention and Remediation programme in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire in light of the risk of child labour in cocoa supply chains in West Africa. In 2023/24, we revised our Human Rights Standard to make it easier for our suppliers to understand our requirements. Audit remains a core component of our Standard and managing risk in our supply chain, however we are driving our ""beyond audit"" approach through our Worker Voice and Human Rights Due Diligence Programmes with our supply chain partners. We recognise the limitations of an audit-only approach, and engage directly with workers in our supply chain (worker voice) and build suppliers' capacity to address human rights risks further down the supply chain (human rights due diligence). Worker voice 2023/24 was the third year of our Worker Voice Programme, which builds on our compliance programme and ensures we hear directly from workers in our supply chain across UK & ROI. Over the past year, 361 of our sites took part in a joint survey with our delivery partner nGaje, with 40,807 participants across the M&S supply chain (Tier 1 UK & ROI) sharing their views. Human rights due diligence Aligned to volume and risk, 48 of our key strategic supply chain partners took part in the third year of our Human Rights Due Diligence Review Programme in 2023/24 to understand the salient human rights issues in the supply chain and their activity underway or planned to address them. We also delivered bespoke human rights training for our Food technical team.

Over the first six months of the programme, we delivered training to over 500 farmers in three key tea and coffee origins: Peru, Brazil and Malawi. Kely (below), a Peruvian coffee famer, was one of our first trainees. Before Cup of Ambition training, she ran a small 100% organic honey business, in addition to producing coffee as part of the Cooperative Frontera San Ignacio in northern Peru. Thanks to the mindset and financial literacy skills she gained from the programme, Kely has invested in new equipment and doubled her beehives, growing her business and her family's income. More bees mean more pollination for her coffee crop, helping Kely to increase her coffee harvest. In 2024/25, we plan to roll-out the Cup of Ambition programme to our Kenyan tea growers and tea and coffee producers in other origins.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR ESG STRATEGY GOVERNANCE Accountability for the delivery of our ESG strategy sits with our CEO, while the Board provides oversight through our ESG Committee. ENVIRONMENT Strategic responsibility Delivery of our ESG strategy and Plan A is embedded across our nine strategic priorities and through our business-unit led operating model. We utilise data, digital and technology solutions and innovation to support the delivery of our ESG strategy, and data aids ESG decision-making so we focus on the issues that are material to our business, and matter most to customers and wider stakeholders. The ESG projects and programmes inform decisions across all levels and departments. Our business-unit led operating model ensures full accountability for ESG and a straightforward way of working that is embedded into the business, led by the respective Managing Directors. Our central ESG team plays a critical internal oversight role, both supporting the business units, and holding them to account for performance and reporting. This ESG team sits within the wider Corporate Affairs team, reflecting the continued volume of environmental regulations, the range of external stakeholders and the strong link between ESG and the M&S brand. As a result, it also works closely with the business units, Marketing, Risk and Internal Audit, Finance, Legal and Communications teams. ESG Business Forum The ESG Business Forum - a cross-functional group of senior leaders and subject matter experts across M&S that plays a key role in tracking ESG progress against targets - was set up in 2023. It meets on a quarterly basis to review ESG performance, discuss cross- business topics, unblock issues and approve items before they go forward to our ExCo and ESG Committee. Each meeting focuses on performance updates, risk management and innovating our delivery of our net zero goal, as well as topical updates. SOCIAL GOVERNANCE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE ESG DATA BOARD Effective and robust governance underpins our ESG Strategy and there is a clear governance framework in place to support delivery of it. The ExCo, led by the CEO, is accountable for setting and delivering the strategy, with individual Directors accountable for delivery within their areas, and the Corporate Affairs Director accountable for overall delivery of the programme. The ESG Committee provides a strategic oversight role in challenging strategy and supporting delivery plans. The ESG Business Forum supports the accountability and decision-making functions of the ExCo and ESG Committee. LOTS DONE- 2023/24 HIGHLIGHTS Having reset Plan A in 2021, we have mobilised the delivery of our net zero goal and priority actions across the organisation. In 2023/24, we focused on extending the scope of Plan A to areas about which we know our customers care most. We are now sourcing clearer data to support our net zero goal and related targets and map out more accurately how to achieve them. We have also started work to better understand the implications of new regulations that will affect the business, including ESG disclosure requirements and deforestation. Ultimate responsibility for both risk management and ESG framework, including those risks and opportunities related to climate change. Approves the Company's ESG strategy, including the business-wide target to become net zero.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR ESG STRATEGY SOCIAL ESG DATA ENVIRONMENT ESG COMMITTEE REVIEW 11 As ESG Committee Chair it has been great to see another year of positive momentum and progress towards delivery of our net zero and wider ESG goals. Plan A has a critical role to play in delivering exceptional product and upholding our trusted brand. From sourcing and making our products with care, to delivering sustainable, profitable growth through progressing our carbon reduction programme, I thank the ExCo and their teams for continuing to embed the ESG programme into the business. As Stuart says, lots done, lots to do and lots of opportunity! DELIVERY OF OUR ESG STRATEGY The focus for the Committee this year has very much been on driving delivery, and the Committee has welcomed a more granular and engaging level of reporting throughout the year - the benefits of which can be seen in this report. We reviewed the strategic progress being made across each business - Food and Clothing & Home - as well as in our store estate and logistics network. In Food we discussed a wide range of topics including reducing packaging units and innovations in alternative packaging. In Clothing & Home, we challenged the business to go further on plastic reduction in the supply chain and debated our customer circularity proposition. Across our store estate we now have greater visibility of carbon emissions data on a store-by-store basis and the Committee reviewed progress on carbon emission reduction in the logistics network following the integration of Gist. In regards to social issues, the Committee reviewed how the business is making strides to ensure it is doing all it can to protect human rights, and supported the reset of the Community strategy and fantastic anchor partnership with YoungMinds. PERFORMANCE UPDATES AND REPORTING The Committee has been encouraged to see an improvement to the internal ESG governance and data management processes flowing from the regular cadence of meetings and disclosure from the ESG Business Forum to the ExCo and then the Committee, including improvements to the basis of reporting for ESG-related disclosures. The resulting quarterly performance updates showing in-year GOVERNANCE progress against agreed metrics and targets have been clear and the Committee has used these to challenge gaps or issues, and also champion further progress as appropriate. The Committee has received updates on the work undertaken to develop a more detailed level of understanding of our carbon reduction glidepath, particularly in relation to the harder-to-measure Scope 3 emissions which make up 94% of our total inventory. BRAND BUILDING AND ENGAGEMENT The Committee has received quarterly updates from the ESG Reputation Tracker showing how customers view M&S' ESG programme and what matters most to them. We now have a year's worth of data so can see trends and this will be used in the coming year to further refine the Plan A customer communication and ""brand building"" strategy. In addition, through reviewing the results of in-store ESG messaging audits, the Committee has challenged the business to create a clear and aligned way of communicating to customers ""at the shelf edge"", so that Plan A has a consistent and recognisable identity across all touchpoints. OUTSIDE-IN AND RISKS The Committee has been fortunate enough to have welcomed external speakers and experts and heard their views as part of our horizon-scanning of ESG themes, trends and threats. We have heard valued contributions and conducted healthy debate on a range of subjects and these outside-in views have provided useful challenge and insight, which contributes to the refinement of our strategy. In addition to the views of experts, the Committee has discussed and assessed ESG risks and opportunities, in order to advise the Audit & Risk Committee in their half-year and full-year review of principal risks. We have also been made aware of the increasingly complex and changing ESG regulations and standards that are likely to impact the business in the coming years and are supportive of the trials with Artificial Intelligence that can help us spot positive or negative ESG trends. FOCUS FOR THE YEAR AHEAD In the coming year we will be reviewing our carbon reduction glidepath given the improved understanding we have of our Scope 3 emissions, as well as understanding the new FLAG guidance, and considering whether we need to expand our ESC strategy beyond its current areas of focus. In addition, we will consider the ESG Reputation Tracker data to ensure we are effectively communicating to customers and wider stakeholders on the issues that matter most to them. We will continue to hold the ExCo to account for delivery of agreed targets and challenge where there are gaps. Underpinning all of this will be constructive challenge for the ExCo and their teams to make sure we continue to always aim higher, innovate, and use the best ""outside-in"" stimulation from external leaders and subject matter experts.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY GOVERNANCE OUR STRATEGY ENVIRONMENT ESG DATA INTRODUCTION The metrics in this report are those we believe are the most relevant and material to the sustainability challenges we face. They also reflect what our customers, colleagues and investors see as important to our business. The majority of the data and statements in this report relate to our most recent financial year (2023/24) and the previous financial year (2022/23). Where data relates to the calendar year or another period, this is clearly stated. Note that percentage change and summed total figures in this report may not align precisely to the figures provided in data tables due to rounding. Detail on how the data in this report has been prepared is in our Basis of Reporting 2024. C Go to our Basis of Reporting 2024 REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY M&S has access to a Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), agreed in December 2021 and updated in November 2022. Under the terms of the RCF, the applicable interest rate may be adjusted each year (downward or upward) depending on whether we meet all, some or none of the targets in place across the four agreed sustainability KPIs. SUSTAINABILITY KPIS Proportion of soy used in animal feed sourced from physically certified deforestation and conversion-free supply chains SOCIAL ESG DATA We have updated targets for each financial year between now and financial year 2025/26. The sustainability-related KPIs remain unchanged following the November 2022 update and focus on material emissions hotspots aligned with our net zero roadmap, and which lend themselves to annual updates during the lifetime of the facility. This data is subject to a separate external assurance process scheduled to be published in autumn 2024. We will publish our Basis of Reporting document for our RCF sustainability-related KPIs, outlining the scope and methodology, alongside our performance update in autumn 2024.

"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY OUR STRATEGY ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ESG DATA INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT TO THE DIRECTORS OF MARKS AND SPENCER PLC Marks and Spencer plc (""M&S"") commissioned DNV Business Assurance Services UK Limited (""DNV"", ""us"" or ""we"") to conduct a limited assurance engagement over Selected Information presented in the M&S ESG Report 2024 (the ""Report"") for the reporting period 2 April 2023 to 30 March 2024. Our Conclusion: On the basis of the work undertaken, nothing came to our attention to suggest that the Selected Information is not fairly stated and has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria. This conclusion relates only to the Selected Information, and is to be read in the context of this Independent Limited Assurance Report, in particular the inherent limitations explained overleaf. Our observations and areas for improvement will be raised in a separate report to M&S Management. SELECTED INFORMATION The scope and boundary of our work is restricted to the Indicators included within the Report for the 2024 Reporting period (the ""Selected Information""), listed in the Appendix. To assess the Selected Information, which includes an assessment of the risk of material misstatement in the Report, we have used M&S Basis of Reporting (the ""Criteria""), which can be found here. We have not performed any work, and do not express any conclusion, on any other information that may be published in the Report or on M&S website for the current reporting period or for previous periods. BASIS OF OUR CONCLUSION We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the Selected Information; our work included, but was not restricted to: - Conducting interviews with M&S management to obtain an understanding of the key processes, systems and controls in place to generate, aggregate and report the Selected Information; - Performing limited substantive testing on a selective basis of the Selected Information to check that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported; For the ""RSPO Certified Sustainable Palm Oil with Segregated status (% of all palm oil)"" metric the source evidence checked was the RSPO certification held by the palm oil suppliers provided by a M&S third party consultant contracted by M&S. - Reviewing that the evidence, measurements and their scope provided to us by M&S for the Selected Information is prepared in line with the Criteria; - Assessing the appropriateness of the Criteria for the Selected Information; and - Reading the Report and narrative accompanying the Selected Information within it with regard to the Criteria. In performing these activities, we did not come across limitations to the scope of the agreed assurance engagement. We found a limited number of non-material errors and these were corrected prior to inclusion in the Report. STANDARD AND LEVEL OF ASSURANCE We performed a limited assurance engagement of specified data and information using the 'Greenhouse Protocol - A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard' (revised 2015) and international assurance best practice including the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 - 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information' (revised) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. To ensure consistency in our assurance process, we conducted our work in accordance with DNV's assurance methodology, Verisustain™, applying only the pertinent sections of the protocol relevant to the specific purpose of the activity. This methodology ensures compliance with ethical requirements and mandates planning and execution of the assurance engagement to obtain the desired level of assurance. DNV applies its own management standards and compliance policies for quality control, which are based on the principles enclosed within ISO IEC 17029:2019 - Conformity Assessment - General principles and requirements for validation and verification bodies, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and are shorter in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained if a reasonable assurance engagement had been performed. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS OF M&S AND DNV THE DIRECTORS OF M&S HAVE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR: - Preparing and presenting the Selected information in accordance with the Criteria; - Designing, implementing and maintaining effective internal controls over the information and data, resulting in the preparation of the Selected Information that is free from material misstatements; - Measuring and reporting the Selected Information based on their established Criteria; and - Contents and statements contained within the Report and the Criteria. Our responsibility is to plan and perform our work to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected Information has been prepared in accordance with the Criteria and to report to M&S in the form of an independent limited assurance conclusion, based on the work performed and the evidence obtained. We have not been responsible for the preparation of the Report. Marks and Spencer Group plc ESG Report 2024 62",0.0699813258636788
"PERFORMANCE SUMMARY GOVERNANCE ESG DATA OUR STRATEGY DISCLAIMERS The assurance provided by DNV is limited to the selected metrics and information specified in the scope of the engagement.
