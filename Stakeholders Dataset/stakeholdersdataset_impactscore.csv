"COMPANY PROFILE With a market cap of USD 1.3 billion and 85 years of rich business experience, Arvind is one of the oldest and most respected conglomerates in India. The Group has varied business interests, ranging from textiles, retail and advanced materials, to environmental solutions and real estate. We started life as a spinning and weaving unit in 1931 and have grown over the years. But one thing has remained constant: Change. In mid- 1980s, when several large composite mills in the country were in crisis due to the introduction of power looms, we adopted the 'Reno-vision' business strategy that focussed on international markets and high-quality premium fabrics. Within a decade, we were among the top three denim producers in the world. WE MANAGE 15 GLOBAL APPAREL BRANDS IN INDIA REGISTERED 22 WE HAVE GLOBAL PATENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS OVER 80,000 ACRES OF FARMLAND UNDER ORGANIC & BCI CULTIVATION In the last two decades, we have introduced some of the biggest clothing brands to cater to the changing needs of the aspirational Indian. The growing presence in the readymade garment domain has now put Arvind on the top as one-stop solution provider for leading global and domestic apparel brands. In the last few years, we have also played a part in transforming the way clothes are made and worn, by collaborating with international brands and enhancing the scope of sustainable fibres. Year after year, we continue to bring world-class technologies and best practices to Indian textile industries; at the same time, we also continue to indigenise and innovate better equipment and production processes. It has been our constant endeavour to be a responsible corporate citizen - not just for the society, but also for the environment. In 2010-11, we became one of the first implementation partners of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) in India. BCI seeks to enhance the profitability of farmers, while simultaneously minimising the environmental impact of cotton farming. We have also been one of the proponents of organic cotton cultivation amongst Indian cotton farmers.

"CASE STUDY KEEPING A KEEN EYE ON LEGAL COMPLIANCE Challenge We consider legal compliance as one of the cornerstones of an effective and efficient Corporate Governance framework. Traditionally, a select group of professionals used to monitor the compliance status of the Company. In the last 5 years, we have recorded exponential growth and have expanded into new businesses and geographies. Additionally, over the years, legislations and regulatory requirements have also been changing dynamically. All these factors necessitated a structured monitoring mechanism. Intervention In early 2014, we commissioned a large global consulting firm to help us create a new, more comprehensive compliance monitoring mechanism. Through collaboration, we created a customised repository of legal compliances applicable to our large businesses, identified roles in the organisational hierarchy that would be responsible for ensuring the compliance and prepared an online dashboard to review the status of legal compliances. To drive this project, a small task force was constituted in early 2015. The responsibilities of the special task force included: Â· Working with the implementation partner during the implementation phase Â· Supporting the qualitative review of database and imparting training to users Â· Engaging with individual employees on a one-on-one basis to help inculcate the practice of reporting the compliance status in the new reporting tool In early 2016, the new framework was rolled out for Textile, Garments and Brands businesses. A comprehensive tool has been created with features like: Â· Weekly notification for compliances that would become due in the next week Â· Reminder for pending compliances as well as notification for compliances that are fulfilled but not updated in the system Â· Provision to update the status of compliance in the tool with an option to uploading the proof of compliance (like copy of challan, return, extract of register etc.) The details provided by the concerned individual are reported to their HOD for review and approval. An online dash board is available with senior management to review the status of legal compliance across businesses, locations, departments, legislation category, and period etc. Impact & Way Forward The new legal compliance framework has been stabilised across the Textile business; i.e. Denim, Woven and Voiles. Garmenting and Brands are slowly catching up. The online tool is now able to provide a real-time status of legal compliances, identify concern which allows the management to take prompt actions. Sustaining such a framework has its own challenges. There are constant changes in legislations, ownership, roles and responsibility, businesses, addition of new employees. Besides, there is a need for conducting regular training and refresher modules. To meet these challenges, we have created a dedicated team that is responsible for monitoring the status of updates, follow up with individuals to update the status for pending items, training/re-training, addressing requests for change in mapping and auditing the compliances on a sample basis. 14 ",Regulatory & Legal Challenges,1.2693975635781016

"Cotton was cultivated in the cradles of the civilisation. And today, despite a number of natural and artificial fibres, cotton still continues to remain in vogue. Being one of the largest producers of textiles and garments in India, cotton continues to remain a key input material for us - something that is essential for us to be fundamentally right. With the demand for garments growing, sustained supply of this vital ingredient, in sufficient volumes and at competitive rates, is material to us. SO WE ARE INVESTING TOWARDS CREATING AN ECOSYSTEM WHICH SECURES OUR INPUT, SAFEGUARDS FARMERS' INTERESTS AND ENHANCES FARM YIELD. Cotton farming is an extremely resource intensive process.

"CONSUMPTION The consumption of cotton is predicted to increase, as the global textile industry is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4-5% over the next 10 years. Moreover, the expanding Indian middle class and increasing disposable incomes are poised to grow the Indian textile industry at a CAGR of 9-10% over the next decade. This translates to a corresponding progress for us; but also means a continuous climb in cotton requirement. This cotton supply should not only be smooth and of high quality, but also sustainable for the farmers and the environment. In the last two years, output at our Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) project farms as well as organic farms stagnated as the farmers opted for alternative cash crops. Nonetheless, we still remain confident of the long-term merits of both these cultivation methods and are determined to continue encouraging them in the times to come. Here is how our Akola-based Organic & BCI farm projects performed during the reporting period. 73,584 67,436 2013-14 2014-15 87,434 2015-16 Compared to FY 2013-14, here was an 8% and 15% drop in the area under cultivation in FY 2015-16.

India's domestic and international market for organic food, flowers, and pharmaceutical extracts (such as marigolds) is growing rapidly, making this trend particularly prevalent amongst organic cotton farmers. 8,482 9,446 2013-14 2014-15 11,155 2015-16 26","Policies, Standards, Code of Conduct",1.2232199995421462
"OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLE COTTON We need to ensure an uninterrupted supply chain, while remaining watchful that the cotton farmers, the community and the mother Earth reap the benefits as well. To make cotton farming sustainable and responsible, we need to understand and address the challenges across all three bottom lines. ECONOMIC SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL The challenge is to safeguard farmers' interest, while ensuring the supply. The need of the hour is to find more effective and efficient methods of farming, enhancing farm yield and reducing social evils like child labour. The task on hand is to find environmental friendly processes, to meet the continuously increasing demand. WE BELIEVE THAT WHAT COMES OUT DEPENDS ON WHAT GOES IN. As one of the implementers of Better Cotton Initiative in India and as one of the early proponents of organic farming, WE INVEST IN SAFEGUARDING THE SOIL'S SUSTAINABILITY AND SECURING THE FARMERS' INTERESTS; SUCH THAT WE CAN EXPECT A CONTINUAL SUPPLY OF OUR RAW MATERIAL.

"ORGANIC COTTON Organic cotton farming is the process of growing cotton as it was always meant to be - devoid of any genetic modification, without any artificial fertilizers or pesticides and in harmony with the cycles of nature. This not only protects the soil and groundwater; it also reduces the overall cost. Rotational cropping of leguminous crops like pulses, and scientific practices improve the yield per acre over time. In addition to spreading awareness about the benefits of organic farming, we also help farmers in forming Self Help Groups (SHGs) and create a self-sustainable, mutual support system, where peer-power is harnessed for problem solving and mobilising funds. THE STORY TILL NOW Inception of Organic Cotton Farming project to provide genuine organic fibres to customers Timely completion of certification by reputed third party agencies.

"CASE STUDY TAKING CHILD LABOUR OUT OF FARMS Challenge Despite being the second largest producer of cotton in the world, India is still dominated by a large number of small farms; usually less than 2 acres. This small size makes automation economically unviable for majority of the farmers. The only option left is manual labour. Cotton farms in India have also involved child labour during various stages of farming: sowing, weeding and cotton picking. What makes child labour at farms different from other situations, is the fact that quite often the children work on the farms owned by their own family. Although in such situations, the work environment is slightly better than in conventional child labour, it is still robbing the children off their childhood and education. Child labour in cotton farms also have an adverse health impact on children over a period of time. Intervention At the inception of the supply chain project of Organic and BCI cotton farming at Akola, we did a detailed study by conducting field surveys in different villages, to analyse the issue of children working in the farms. WE HAVE A STRICT ANTI-CHILD LABOUR POLICY AT OUR PREMISES. WE ENSURE ZERO CHILD LABOUR AT OUR ORGANIC AND BCI COTTON FARMS. To ensure its discontinuation, we set up a dedicated team which is based in the farming area to sensitise farmers about the adverse impact of involving child labour, and benefits of education and schooling through: Â· Regular training programmes, conducting events like street plays, essay competition, film screening, children's summer camps, etc. Â· Formation of child group and its awareness training, learning group awareness training Â· Interactions with labourers to ensure that they don't send their children to work in farms Â· School visits & interaction with school authorities Our procurement policies are in line with our no child labour policy. We are also implementing mechanisation projects to reduce manual labour, thus impacting child labour. Regular visits and monitoring at the farms and the schools, ensure that no child below 18 years is employed in the farm.",Training & Development,1.0855639521403866
"DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES When we develop potentials that have never been tapped, we unlock productivity and passion that has never been seen. We conduct a wide array of development programmes across the organisational hierarchy. Pragati - Development Programme for Supervisors Pragati helps supervisors set expectations of their roles and responsibilities, manage self and others. The programme enhances self- awareness, inculcates skills to manage Front Line Managers (FLMs) at the workplace, helps develop better relationships for better results and boosts overall capability to become effective in their current role. We plan to train 450 supervisors under Pragati. In 2015-16, we trained 20. iRise - Junior Manager Development Programme iRise is focused towards enhancing the overall capability of individual contributors and shift managers and help them perform their role more effectively. The initiative is termed as iRise as it signifies the rise of an individual in terms of undertaking more responsibility by becoming more accountable to the organisation. 43 managers were trained under iRise in 2015-16. 37 Continuing Education Towards the end of 2015-16, we introduced a progressive continuing education policy for all management cadre employees. It encourages them to take-up higher studies and thereby upgrade their knowledge and skills. The programme is at a nascent stage right now, but we expect it to grow in the coming years. 26 employees are currently enrolled for new higher-education courses under this programme iGnite - Manager Development Programme iGnite equips managers with the requisite competence to achieve the strategic objectives of the organisation, build skills for effective problem solving and decision making, plus develop interpersonal and leadership skills for better team management. 60 managers were trained under iGnite in 2014-15. In 2015-16, an additional 34 managers were trained. Samvad - Dialogue for Development An initiative aimed at identifying and creating a high potential talent pool. Every year under Samvad, we identify and assess select employees from senior management and take them through a structured development journey. The programme includes sharing individual reports and feedback to the employee by a coach. It also includes creation of a development plan and talent review with the business head. iLead - Leadership Development Programme These programmes aide the senior management executives to hone their leadership skills, develop an attitude for success, and mould them into able professionals who can positively transform business results.",Training & Development,1.0902624604752447
"NEEV - LAYING A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR PRODUCTIVITY In the reporting period, we embarked on a new employee- excellence journey with the introduction of NEEV - a comprehensive, company-wide, competency-based standard to identify employee potential, grade their performance, and chart for them a structured career growth plan. As part of the NEEV Framework, employees have been segmented in five distinct groups based on their organisational roles. 1. Strategic leaders CEO / CXO / Corporate Function Heads 2. Functional leaders Leading Large/Multiple Functions, direct reportees to CEO, CXO, Specialists 3. Team managers Managers who have first level managers reporting into them 4. First level managers Managers who manage one or many Independent contributors 5. Individual contributors Managing work in individual capacity Requisite levels of competencies that an employee must possess under each of the group have been well-spelt out. The competencies provide an employee behaviour map, as well as identify skills that will be valued, recognised and rewarded. Training need identification, appraisal and career progression - all stem from the employee's competency proficiency level. Introduced during the reporting period, NEEV will be cascaded across the organisation in a phased manner. INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS THE CORE OBJECTIVE OF THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS FUNCTION IS TO STRIKE A HARMONIOUS BALANCE BETWEEN PERSONAL AND ORGANISATIONAL GOALS. WELL-MEANING INTENT, FAIRNESS AND TRANSPARENCY ARE THE KEY ENABLERS IN THIS JOURNEY. We have recognised worker unions at both our manufacturing operations - Naroda and Santej and our Industrial Relations (IR) department organises a variety of events and activities across locations to engage with the FLMs and keep them enthused.",Training & Development,1.081297375152854
"We have structured policies and processes under the various management standards pertaining to prohibition of employment of child & forced labour; freedom of association and right to collective bargaining; grievances redressal mechanism; working hours; remuneration; health & safety; discrimination; engagement & welfare initiatives; disciplinary proceedings etc. All such policies & processes have been communicated to all stakeholders (internal / external) in most amicable way. Also, we review the same from time to time and communicate the changes, if any, to all concerned stakeholders well in advance. A TEST OF IR EFFECTIVENESS AT SANTEJ Our Santej facility operates around the clock and in three shift operations. To keep the operations running smoothly, we have dedicated Industrial Relations professionals to oversee the shop-floor activities on a continuous basis. In addition, division-wise union representatives of the Textile Labour Association are also on-hand 24x7 to ensure smooth operations and effective redressal of grievances. Yet sometimes, despite our best intentions and robust practices, there are undesirable outcomes. In one such instance, a section of the FLMs suddenly went on a strike at the Santej plant, in October 2015. On closer examination, it was found that the agitation was being fuelled by an external labour union that had no legal affiliations with the FLMs at Santej. The strike was thus deemed illegal by both the state government as well as the honourable industrial tribunal. But while the judiciary was taking its course, the IR team swung into action and initiated a dialogue with the FLMs on strike. The issue was amicably resolved in two days with the FLMs coming back to work unconditionally. 39 INITIATIVE UPGRADATION OF FLM CANTEEN AT NARODA During the reporting period, we completely overhauled and upgraded the FLM canteen at Naroda. Â· A larger and better designed seating area Â· Enhanced hygiene standards in the cooking area as well as the seating area Â· Card-based access system for better management and accounting HUMAN RIGHTS To protect human rights is to ensure that people receive decent, humane treatment. We have a well-defined human rights policy that upholds the human rights of our employees and FLMs. We don't discriminate against our employees and they are free to join unions or association for the protection of their interests. We do not employ children at workplaces and do not use forced labour in any form. During the year, there were no instances of reported human rights violations or gender discrimination.

In the textile industry, due to the inflammable nature of our raw materials, fire is a key risk. A comprehensive fire protection system has been implemented at all our facilities with the objective to prevent fire in the first place and in case of any incident, mitigate its spread and extinguish it at the earliest. Additionally, we have introduced SOPs that are common to many industries, but are not usually seen in textile facilities. This includes work permit systems, use of industry-grade Personal Protection Equipment like safety shoes and masks. We also iterated our focus on safety to everyone in the production line by starting a series of weekly safety meets to take stock of on-ground situations and address them in a timely manner.","Employee Health, Safety & Wellness",1.097502603467809

"COMBATING FIRE INCIDENTS SANTEJ Challenge In textile factories, most of the materials - raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods are flammable. Even the processes are prone to instigate fire. It is therefore of utmost importance that fire prevention is well-implemented and in the unlikely event of fire, well-thought out protection is available. Intervention A state-of-the-art fire protection system has been installed at our Santej facility. It includes equipment to actively detect fire and well-established systems to control a fire if it were to ever occur. Also part of the exercise was the rationalising of components to curb the spread of the fire and training the staff. ÐÐ¯ Salient Points of the Fire Protection System Â· Extra vigilance to manage fire triggers viz. phasing out loose electrical wire. Â· Strengthening access to firefighting equipment and reinforcement of mock drills Â· Mutual aid with Vadsar Air Force Base to assist one another in the event of any emergency Â· Conducting various fire awareness drive viz. fire demonstration and training Â· Installation and revamping of fire hydrants systems as well as interconnection of fire hydrants systems Â· Segregation of materials incompatible with one another Â· Implementation of permit to work system for hot work fire safety STEAM INERTISATION SYSTEM Steam inertisation system has been installed at various processing machines at Santej facility to mitigate the spread of accidental fires. Extra steam lines measuring 1-inch in diameter have been grouped from the main steam lines so that even a layman can use them in the event of fire. 10 Earlier, the facility witnessed frequent fire incidences in the processing machines due to their temperature exceeding 150â. 43 ","Employee Health, Safety & Wellness",1.0809647239852616

Thus, for our Santej unit the commitment to achieve 'Zero Accidents' was followed with a checklist of challenges right from ensuring robust safety policies, processes, and infrastructure to embedding safety awareness among workforce. Intervention The only way to bring about a lasting impact in our safety performance, is to root out hazards at the bud. A comprehensive safety management plan has been implemented at Santej which incorporates best practices to address all key enablers of safety excellence: policies & processes, infrastructure management, awareness & training, implementation & audit, emergency preparedness.

"STRENGTHENING OF WORK PERMIT SYSTEM Various ongoing maintenance and construction related activities were major contributors to the overall accident numbers. We implemented a work permit system during the reporting period, which helped us govern the safety measures that are required for a particular task according to the risk analysis carried out by Safety Department for that particular work. We also implemented 'Lock-Out-Tag-Out' procedures for any maintenance activity to be carried out in hazard prone areas. INTRODUCTION OF WEEKLY MEETINGS & DEPLOYMENT OF PPE Upon analysis of several incidents from 2013-14, it was observed that a lot of injuries could have been avoided if the workmen were adhering to the stipulated use of PPEs. One of the key intervention implemented over 2015-16 was strict enforcement and counselling on adherence to PPE usage which included upgrade of several PPE to better quality materials - especially safety shoes, ear plugs and masks. Additionally, a weekly meeting of all the department heads is being organised to discuss the accidents and incidents during the past week, their investigation reports and corrective action taken in view of the incidents. These two initiatives led to improvement in working conditions by eliminating unsafe conditions as well as PPE helped in reduction in injuries.

"FOCUS AREAS OF SHARDA TRUST We believe in spearheading programmes, and not projects. The objective is to institutionalise systemic change, not symptomatic band-aid. We aim to make a lasting difference to the lives of people, even if it sometimes takes years in the making. Our corporate headquarters and two of our biggest manufacturing facilities are based in and around Ahmedabad, and thus most of our initiatives are centred in these regions. To ensure that we don't spread ourselves too thin we have zeroed in on three impact areas: 1 <+ EDUCATION 2 PRIMARY HEALTHCARE 3 DEVELOPING VOCATIONAL SKILLS EDUCATION Education is the most powerful tool in the fight against poverty and social evils. An educated generation will be the last generation in poverty. It is also a gift that once given stays with the recipient for their entire life. GYANDA PROGRAMME Broadly, there are three kinds of education models: Â· Formal schools set up by local and national governments Â· Informal education facilitated through volunteers, educationist or NGOs Â· Tuition classes that supplement school education and concentrate on specific subjects Setting up schools or tuition centres involves large investment in land and infrastructure. The quantum of investment results in few schools and limited impact. Volunteering efforts may be noble in intention but are limited in longevity. Mindful of the limitations of each of the education models, the education experts at SHARDA Foundation designed the Gyanda programme - a new hybrid model that is mix of supplementary education and formal school set-up. Arvind Ltd. has been supporting the Gyanda Programme since its inception in 2006. Leveraging existing infrastructure Gyanda has been specially designed to supplement the education of children studying in Municipal Schools and support them to complete the school and college education. The aim is to improve their academic performance and overall personality while ensuring that children don't drop out and complete their basic education from classes 5 to 12. A financial support programme has also been developed to aid underprivileged students. Approach Â· Increase the enrolment of children of the urban poor into the programme Â· Inject technology in municipal schools by providing computer laboratories, projection facilities and internet access for staff and students in schools Â· Lay emphasis on efficient and effective functionality of the programme, leading to substantial impact in student lives The Gyanda programme is unique because no other supplementary education model tracks the performance of all its students while maintaining direct contact with the parents for the entire schooling journey of 6-8 years and beyond for higher education.",Community Development,1.0405232538440008
"Interventions Primary School Programme This programme works with the students of class 5, 6 and 7 studying in a number of municipal schools in Ahmedabad through two-hour long support classes on Gujarati, Maths, English and Computers conducted by SHARDA teachers within the municipal school premises and also through an education support centre where students from multiple schools attend. Secondary School Programme The academic curriculum expands tremendously after class 8 and requires a lot of personalised attention and subject-wise coaching. We conduct 3-hour classes for these students after school hours. Currently, there are 2 centres where these classes are conducted. Admission Facilitation & Financial Support We facilitate admissions in higher classes in various schools as per the merit and choice of the students.

"PRIMARY HEALTHCARE Healthcare in India continues to be a trade-off between availability, affordability and quality - if it is available and affordable, the quality is suspect; and if it is available and of good quality, it is seldom affordable. Even in urban areas, there are pockets where healthcare services are not easily available or affordable. Keeping this in mind, SHARDA Trust signed an MoU with Swasth Foundation to set up primary health centres, called Arvind Clinics, in the urban slum areas of Ahmedabad.

We also encouraged and supported employment of people from within nearby communities. Our senior management consists entirely of Indian citizens, and our employees and workmen are predominantly from the communities where our manufacturing facilities are located. While local procurement is something we deeply believe in, we still have to source a sizeable quantity of cotton from outside India. This is because quite a few of our customers demand for particular varieties of cotton like Egyptian, Australian and Brazilian owing to their special characteristics.

At Bengaluru, daylight harvesting system resulted in 90% power saving INITIATIVES TURNING INCINERATORS INTO HEAT HARNESSERS - SANTEJ UNIT Heat recovery is an established approach to harness the power of steam, a key energy source in textile operations. Incinerators are great tools not just to manage waste, but also to generate thermal energy. Building on this approach, we installed heat exchangers in steam boiler nearby the incineration system for generating steam. With a capacity worth 2,000 litre/hour at a 70â rise temperature, the exchangers will further add to the heat recovery strength of Arvind. Total capital cost of this intervention is INR 12 Lac, and the energy returned on the investment is 400 kg of coal saved per day. HARNESSING THE POWER OF NATURE SANTEJ, NARODA & BENGALURU UNITS Mother nature offers resources aplenty. The trick is to leverage them effectively. At Arvind, we seek to harness the power of sun, in the most natural and productive manner. Some of our units, wherever feasible, have incorporated skylights to let the nature light in and brighten the spaces. This has effectively reduced the need for artificial lighting resulting in energy savings of 570 kWh per day. In order to minimise the usage of artificial lights in the washing area of our Bengaluru unit, we installed a daylight harvesting system comprising light tubes and skylights. This has resulted in around 90% power saving. Between April 2014 and April 2016, the unit reported power savings of more than 60,400 kwh. 76 ",Energy Management,1.0246479749351434

"WATER MANAGEMENT & CONSERVATION INITIATIVES SANTEJ UNIT Our Santej unit is equipped with a Wastewater Treatment Plant which recycles up to 98% of our effluent. Thus, the net withdrawal of the water from bore wells is limited to evaporation and consumption losses. But there is always room for improvement. If we cannot enhance the quantum of water conserved, we can conserve the amount of energy used to conserve this water. Thus, during the reporting period, we introduced technologies and process that make water conservation more energy-efficient. INITIATIVE ELECTRO OXIDATION PROCESS To enhance energy efficiency and reduce sludge generation, Electro Chemical Oxidation was introduced as a pilot project in the ETP at Santej. In this process, the pollutants are broken down through oxidation at the anode and are transformed into non-toxic substances. Thereby, the effluent's COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) is reduced substantially. This technology is simple, eco- friendly, energy-efficient and has low maintenance cost. The treated wastewater can be then effectively reused for dyeing application. Plans are afoot to scale up the process in future. ONE BATH BIO-POLISHING AND DYEING Bio-polishing is a finishing process that enhances fabric quality by decreasing the pilling tendency and fuzziness of (cellulose) knitted fabrics. In the regular process, the fabric undergoes a number of baths like pre-treatment, dyeing and bio-polishing. Thereafter it goes for finishing and is finally packed. Each bath consumes substantial quantities of water. We have devised and incorporated a sustainable process where bio-polishing and dyeing happen in the same bath saving water, steam, energy and time. Single bath bio-polishing and dyeing is carried out for almost 95% of piece dyed fabrics. WE HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THIS PROCESS SAVES ABOUT 6.5 LITRE OF WATER PER KG OF KNIT FABRIC PROCESSED AND 21 TONNES OF STEAM PER MONTH. 83 T A W M P T N N WATER CONSUMPTION AT SANTEJ UNIT HAS BEEN REDUCED BY ENHANCING THE UTILISATION OF MACHINE EFFICIENCY AND THROUGH A COMBINATION OF STEPS SUCH AS: Creating awareness about draining and flushing during changeover from dark shade to light shade, such that unnecessary flushing doesn't happen Each machine operator has been trained to optimise utilisation of water; this training and behavioural change has helped us save around 3 300-400 m of water per day In sanforiser, the water required to cool the blanket is now being collected in trough and is reused in the process; resulting in savings of 3 150 m water per day",Water Use & Management,1.0190671169139551

"SPILL MANAGEMENT POLICY Unplanned or uncontrolled release of hazardous chemical is an occupational hazard that is, unfortunately, a possibility in any industry that involves chemical. But like all accidents, its probability can be minimised. Even in case of an untoward occurrence, the extent of damage can well be contained if SOPs are in place. Our Spill Management Policy is aimed to ensure cautious management of hazardous material spills. The policy is applicable to all departments, employees, contractors, and visitors. In addition to giving a comprehensive SOP to deal with major and minor spills, the policy also elucidates the dos and don'ts to handle spills of special chemicals like organic material, alkali and acids. INITIATIVES INDIGENISED SPILL KITS AUTO DOSING FOR MORE SAFETY AND QUALITY > LAWER DYEMATIC SPILL CONT 'SAND SPILL CONTR SAWDUST All departments handling hazardous chemical are equipped with spill kits. The challenge that we usually face in procuring these spill kits is that the replacement of the kits is both time consuming and costly, because good quality, industrial grade spill kits are usually imported. To find a way around this, we have indigenised one of the most critical and most used components of the spill kit known as 'barrier'. Designed to perfection, the effectiveness of these indigenised barriers is at par with the commercial ones. This innovation is helping us to curtail the cost of the kit per department, and most importantly, it is eliminating the possibility of running out of access to the spill kit. It is our conscious endeavour to ensure safety and control over the chemicals and dyes which are an indispensable part of our manufacturing processes. Our Woven & Knits Unit at Santej involves high levels of chemical consumption. Previously, these chemicals had to be manually sorted, mixed as per the required recipe and loaded onto machines for further processing. This manual intervention had the potential to cause both health hazards as well as human errors. In order to protect our workers and to ensure the consistency across production batches, we introduced SCADA-based auto dosing system. Auto dosing dispenses both solid and liquid chemicals and dyes in accurate quantities at pre-determined intervals - thereby lending speed and efficiency to bulk production. As a result of this intervention, our Santej Unit now has: Â· Steady reduction in the direct human exposure to hazardous chemicals and dyes; ensuring better employee health and safety Â· Increased precision in accuracy and quantity; leading to better quality and minimum wastage Â· Complete traceability of order history Due to the measurable benefits of the auto dosing system, we are in the process of incorporating it at our Bengaluru unit also.",Environmental Accidents & Remediation,1.0331976914398056

"WASTE REDUCTION INITIATIVES AT SANTEJ UNIT REDUCTION IN HARD WASTE REDUCING WASTE THROUGH AUTOMATION To minimise the manual errors during packaging, we have introduced automated packing machine that can be programmed and monitored through microprocessor interface. This machine works on the functions like auto rolling, cutting, sampling, labelling & palletizing. In addition to eliminating manual errors in marking or weightage, it also saves on the packing time. The hard waste generation in textile industry occurs after the spinning process. Hence, this waste not only contains valuable raw material but has also been processed using valuable resources. It is our continuing endeavour to minimise the generation of hard waste at our facilities. · Introduced the use of non-woven filters based spring packages instead of PP packaging · In the past, soft winding was performed on weight basis. The process has been changed to length basis; resulting in decreased warping waste · In selvedge cutting, the edge trimmers have been optimised with adjusted cutter positions. This resulted in reduction of waste amounting to 1,000 kg/month · Previously, roll identification mark was mentioned horizontally on each roll. This marking is now being mentioned vertically, thereby preventing around 10 cm of fabric width from being cut. Considering an average roll length of 165 m at shirting unit, this translates into fabric savings of 165,000 sq.cm. per roll GOING PFC-FREE IN WATER-REPELLENT FINISHES Since many decades, perfluorochemicals (PFCs) have been used in water-repellent finishes and in waterproof membranes in outdoor apparel. The two most commonly used compounds are perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). PFOS is a persistent, bio-accumulative and toxic to mammalian species. Our PFC-free finish is the sustainable water repellent finish where usage of PFOA and PFOS is eliminated. In comparison with C6 & C8 chemistry, PFC-free products have very soft handle and good abrasion resistance. Their washing durability is also high with excellent low temperature curing.

"NO-STONE WASHING AT BENGALURU UNIT Stone washing is used to give a newly manufactured garment a worn-in (or worn-out) appearance. During the stone washing process, pumice stones work like sandpaper to abrade the denims, removing some of the dye particles and enhancing their worn, faded look. This process also makes the denim softer and more flexible. Along with its benefits, stone washing also poses sustainability challanges. After the stone washing process, the denim is required to be washed several times in order to completely get rid of the grit. This washing process includes chemicals like Anti Back Stain (ABS), enzymes and detergents. Over and above increasing chemical and water consumption, stone washing also enhances carbon footprint, as the stones need to be imported from places like Turkey, Indonesia and Greece. In order to address these challenges, we have innovated and created a No-Stone System. No-Stone System 33% lesser water consumption We have replaced the pumice stone with an abrasive drum coating, fastened to the internal drum of the washing machine which can create a number of finishes through flexible abrasion adjustments.

"At our Bengaluru unit, grit generated during stone washing is upcyled and used to manufacture bricks. During FY 14-15 and 15-16, we manufactured 34,600 bricks. Each brick utilises 1.7 kg of waste pumice stone powder; hence we utilised approx. 58,820 kg of waste powder in manufacturing these bricks.

INITIATIVE SALT RECOVERY THROUGH ZERO LIQUID DISCHARGE Our Santej unit is a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) unit. In 1998, the unit invested in ZLD technology to set up an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) with a capacity to treat 17,500 cubic meter of textile effluent per day. In FY 2014, we installed Mechanical Vapour Recompression Evaporation (MVRE) plants in the effluent recycling system for low cost evaporation and recovery of salts dissolved in the effluents. This has enabled us to recover water as well as mixed salt. This recovered salt has substituted glauber salt and vacuum salt used in the dyeing of yarn and fabric.

"WASTE GENERATION & MANAGEMENT WASTE GENERATION Waste is a by-product of the production process and thus, to some extent, its quantity depends on our output. In FY 2015-16, denim production at Naroda witnessed a minor de-growth in volume on account of bottlenecks in capacity utilization due to changes in product mix. On the other hand, woven fabrics and garments business, both showed growth in volume of 4.5% and 28% respectively. New spindles were added to Santej unit during both years and some of the yarn production was also moved to in-house production from the outsourced yarn earlier. This resulted in an increase in non-hazardous solid waste. More specifically, spinning capacity increase has led to the soft waste increase at Santej which almost doubled year on year over the previous reporting period.

"SPILL MANAGEMENT POLICY Unplanned or uncontrolled release of hazardous chemical is an occupational hazard that is, unfortunately, a possibility in any industry that involves chemical. But like all accidents, its probability can be minimised. Even in case of an untoward occurrence, the extent of damage can well be contained if SOPs are in place. Our Spill Management Policy is aimed to ensure cautious management of hazardous material spills. The policy is applicable to all departments, employees, contractors, and visitors. In addition to giving a comprehensive SOP to deal with major and minor spills, the policy also elucidates the dos and don'ts to handle spills of special chemicals like organic material, alkali and acids. INITIATIVES INDIGENISED SPILL KITS AUTO DOSING FOR MORE SAFETY AND QUALITY > LAWER DYEMATIC SPILL CONT 'SAND SPILL CONTR SAWDUST All departments handling hazardous chemical are equipped with spill kits. The challenge that we usually face in procuring these spill kits is that the replacement of the kits is both time consuming and costly, because good quality, industrial grade spill kits are usually imported. To find a way around this, we have indigenised one of the most critical and most used components of the spill kit known as 'barrier'. Designed to perfection, the effectiveness of these indigenised barriers is at par with the commercial ones. This innovation is helping us to curtail the cost of the kit per department, and most importantly, it is eliminating the possibility of running out of access to the spill kit. It is our conscious endeavour to ensure safety and control over the chemicals and dyes which are an indispensable part of our manufacturing processes. Our Woven & Knits Unit at Santej involves high levels of chemical consumption. Previously, these chemicals had to be manually sorted, mixed as per the required recipe and loaded onto machines for further processing. This manual intervention had the potential to cause both health hazards as well as human errors. In order to protect our workers and to ensure the consistency across production batches, we introduced SCADA-based auto dosing system. Auto dosing dispenses both solid and liquid chemicals and dyes in accurate quantities at pre-determined intervals - thereby lending speed and efficiency to bulk production. As a result of this intervention, our Santej Unit now has: · Steady reduction in the direct human exposure to hazardous chemicals and dyes; ensuring better employee health and safety · Increased precision in accuracy and quantity; leading to better quality and minimum wastage · Complete traceability of order history Due to the measurable benefits of the auto dosing system, we are in the process of incorporating it at our Bengaluru unit also.",Chemical Risks and Management,1.0287095326577895

"THE E-SOFT SYSTEM IS LOW MAINTENANCE, EASY TO CLEAN AND ENSURES ZERO DISCHARGE. In comparison to the conventional softening process, e-soft presents the below benefits: REDUCING WATER CONSUMPTION THROUGH EIM The Garment Unit at Bengaluru has been using Environmental Impact Measuring (EIM) software to monitor and control its washing activities since last three years. This software analyses the environmental impact of a garment finishing process across parameters such as: · chemical product use · water consumption · energy consumption · worker health It also measures the impact of the total process and benchmarks the results against a defined environmental threshold. This enables us to compare the environmental impacts of various finishing processes. Our customers can also request access to the environmental information of the washing formulas for their orders.

This ensures 98% water savings, 80% chemical savings and 79% energy savings. e-Soft is based on nanobubble technology which not just negates the need for a separate bath, it also makes spin drying unnecessary and minimises the tumbler drying cycle. 85 e-Soft technology ensures 98% water savings 80% 0 chemical savings and 79% energy savings ",Water Use & Management,1.0101627047519608
"WATER MANAGEMENT & CONSERVATION INITIATIVES SANTEJ UNIT Our Santej unit is equipped with a Wastewater Treatment Plant which recycles up to 98% of our effluent. Thus, the net withdrawal of the water from bore wells is limited to evaporation and consumption losses. But there is always room for improvement. If we cannot enhance the quantum of water conserved, we can conserve the amount of energy used to conserve this water. Thus, during the reporting period, we introduced technologies and process that make water conservation more energy-efficient. INITIATIVE ELECTRO OXIDATION PROCESS To enhance energy efficiency and reduce sludge generation, Electro Chemical Oxidation was introduced as a pilot project in the ETP at Santej. In this process, the pollutants are broken down through oxidation at the anode and are transformed into non-toxic substances. Thereby, the effluent's COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) is reduced substantially. This technology is simple, eco- friendly, energy-efficient and has low maintenance cost. The treated wastewater can be then effectively reused for dyeing application. Plans are afoot to scale up the process in future. ONE BATH BIO-POLISHING AND DYEING Bio-polishing is a finishing process that enhances fabric quality by decreasing the pilling tendency and fuzziness of (cellulose) knitted fabrics. In the regular process, the fabric undergoes a number of baths like pre-treatment, dyeing and bio-polishing. Thereafter it goes for finishing and is finally packed. Each bath consumes substantial quantities of water. We have devised and incorporated a sustainable process where bio-polishing and dyeing happen in the same bath saving water, steam, energy and time. Single bath bio-polishing and dyeing is carried out for almost 95% of piece dyed fabrics. WE HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THIS PROCESS SAVES ABOUT 6.5 LITRE OF WATER PER KG OF KNIT FABRIC PROCESSED AND 21 TONNES OF STEAM PER MONTH. 83 T A W M P T N N WATER CONSUMPTION AT SANTEJ UNIT HAS BEEN REDUCED BY ENHANCING THE UTILISATION OF MACHINE EFFICIENCY AND THROUGH A COMBINATION OF STEPS SUCH AS: Creating awareness about draining and flushing during changeover from dark shade to light shade, such that unnecessary flushing doesn't happen Each machine operator has been trained to optimise utilisation of water; this training and behavioural change has helped us save around 3 300-400 m of water per day In sanforiser, the water required to cool the blanket is now being collected in trough and is reused in the process; resulting in savings of 3 150 m water per day ",Water Use & Management,1.0076871822043498

A dentist with a basic dental engine set-up will be available to handle such cases Diagnosis (Pathological Tests) Many a time, pathological tests end up becoming costlier than doctor's consultation. Moreover, when the doctor prescribes a test, there is always a chance that the patient will neither get them done due to cost constraints, nor will they come for follow-up visit. To prevent this, Arvind Clinics will provide in- house diagnostic services at very affordable rates. Drug (Strip Packed Quality Medicines) For minor ailments, the medicines will be provided through a pharmacy within the clinic set-up Daytime Care Provision for daytime observation, when required AS PER OUR CALCULATIONS, THE MODEL WILL COST A PATIENT ABOUT INR 100 WITH DIAGNOSIS AND THREE DAYS' WORTH OF MEDICINES - WHICH IS ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF WHAT THEY ARE SPENDING NOW. Three Arvind Clinics are expected to be functional in Ahmedabad within a period of 18 months, starting from April 2016. In all, 10 such centres have been envisaged for the city. Each centre is expected to serve about 40 patients per day - thereby serving 10,000 - 12,000 patients every year.",Access to Services,1.0

I now aspire to be a psychological counsellor and I want to indulge in social work and do something for women Ruksana Pursuing MA in Psychology at LD Arts College Future Plans Going forward, we want to identify, assess and prevent drop-outs before they happen. One way of doing this is to monitor gradual drops in marks scored and attendance. For this, we are working on a software that will track each student and monitor academic and attendance data in real time. We plan to integrate a Finishing School Programme in Gyanda. This programme will work on improving their presentation skills, confidence and other life skills required to excel in the professional world. As of 2015-16, 1,300+ students are part of the Gyanda Programme. WE INTEND TO EXPAND THIS TO 6,500 STUDENTS BY 2020.

"Interventions Primary School Programme This programme works with the students of class 5, 6 and 7 studying in a number of municipal schools in Ahmedabad through two-hour long support classes on Gujarati, Maths, English and Computers conducted by SHARDA teachers within the municipal school premises and also through an education support centre where students from multiple schools attend. Secondary School Programme The academic curriculum expands tremendously after class 8 and requires a lot of personalised attention and subject-wise coaching. We conduct 3-hour classes for these students after school hours. Currently, there are 2 centres where these classes are conducted. Admission Facilitation & Financial Support We facilitate admissions in higher classes in various schools as per the merit and choice of the students. Exceptions are also made for students who have shown great interest and perseverance in studies. We also provide comprehensive support which includes payment of education fees, financial support to buy uniforms, books and stationery.

"FOCUS AREAS OF SHARDA TRUST We believe in spearheading programmes, and not projects. The objective is to institutionalise systemic change, not symptomatic band-aid. We aim to make a lasting difference to the lives of people, even if it sometimes takes years in the making. Our corporate headquarters and two of our biggest manufacturing facilities are based in and around Ahmedabad, and thus most of our initiatives are centred in these regions. To ensure that we don't spread ourselves too thin we have zeroed in on three impact areas: 1 <+ EDUCATION 2 PRIMARY HEALTHCARE 3 DEVELOPING VOCATIONAL SKILLS EDUCATION Education is the most powerful tool in the fight against poverty and social evils. An educated generation will be the last generation in poverty. It is also a gift that once given stays with the recipient for their entire life. GYANDA PROGRAMME Broadly, there are three kinds of education models: · Formal schools set up by local and national governments · Informal education facilitated through volunteers, educationist or NGOs · Tuition classes that supplement school education and concentrate on specific subjects Setting up schools or tuition centres involves large investment in land and infrastructure. The quantum of investment results in few schools and limited impact. Volunteering efforts may be noble in intention but are limited in longevity. Mindful of the limitations of each of the education models, the education experts at SHARDA Foundation designed the Gyanda programme - a new hybrid model that is mix of supplementary education and formal school set-up. Arvind Ltd. has been supporting the Gyanda Programme since its inception in 2006. Leveraging existing infrastructure Gyanda has been specially designed to supplement the education of children studying in Municipal Schools and support them to complete the school and college education. The aim is to improve their academic performance and overall personality while ensuring that children don't drop out and complete their basic education from classes 5 to 12. A financial support programme has also been developed to aid underprivileged students. Approach · Increase the enrolment of children of the urban poor into the programme · Inject technology in municipal schools by providing computer laboratories, projection facilities and internet access for staff and students in schools · Lay emphasis on efficient and effective functionality of the programme, leading to substantial impact in student lives The Gyanda programme is unique because no other supplementary education model tracks the performance of all its students while maintaining direct contact with the parents for the entire schooling journey of 6-8 years and beyond for higher education.",Training & Development,1.0053172141783044

So while 'of the people' is our unwavering employee focus, 'for the people' is our unflinching commitment to local communities and the society at large. Our approach to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is based on our conviction that corporations and society are interdependent. Social responsibility thus permeates all business functions creating a 'corporate social integration'.

"CASE STUDY UPGRADATION OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH CLINIC | SANTEJ Challenge The occupational health centre at Santej was capable of handling only primary treatments and in case of major injuries, ailments or emergencies, the patients were required to be shifted to other health facilities in Kalol or Ahmedabad city which are approximately 45 minutes to one hour away. Intervention During the reporting period, in accordance with the Rule 68-U of Gujarat Factories Rules-1963, we upgraded our Occupational Health Centre (OHC) into a state-of-the-art facility that can also cater to more severe medical emergencies. Nime Facilities at the OHC · A ward of 6 beds, and medical stock to treat various occupational injuries and ailments · Equipment to conduct advanced tests like pulmonary function, ECG, Audio metric, Vision test etc. · A medical team consisting of a full time as well as part-time doctors assisted by a nursing staff of 7 members. · An additional ambulance with all requisite medical emergency equipment · In-house medical checkup (Pre-employment, Periodic) of all employees (Approx. 1,500 employees completed till date) · Availability of first aid treatment with cardio pulmonary resuscitation to patient suffering heart attack, electrical shock · Treatment of occupational injuries with minor operation i.e. Stitches on cut wound, first line treatment of head injury, burns injury treatment, etc. · Provision of transferring serious patients through ambulance We have also opened the usage of this upgraded OHC to workers of neighbouring factories.","Employee Health, Safety & Wellness",1.0054653798657462
"STRENGTHENING OF WORK PERMIT SYSTEM Various ongoing maintenance and construction related activities were major contributors to the overall accident numbers. We implemented a work permit system during the reporting period, which helped us govern the safety measures that are required for a particular task according to the risk analysis carried out by Safety Department for that particular work. We also implemented 'Lock-Out-Tag-Out' procedures for any maintenance activity to be carried out in hazard prone areas. INTRODUCTION OF WEEKLY MEETINGS & DEPLOYMENT OF PPE Upon analysis of several incidents from 2013-14, it was observed that a lot of injuries could have been avoided if the workmen were adhering to the stipulated use of PPEs. One of the key intervention implemented over 2015-16 was strict enforcement and counselling on adherence to PPE usage which included upgrade of several PPE to better quality materials - especially safety shoes, ear plugs and masks. Additionally, a weekly meeting of all the department heads is being organised to discuss the accidents and incidents during the past week, their investigation reports and corrective action taken in view of the incidents. These two initiatives led to improvement in working conditions by eliminating unsafe conditions as well as PPE helped in reduction in injuries.

"CASE STUDY COMBATING FIRE INCIDENTS SANTEJ Challenge In textile factories, most of the materials - raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods are flammable. Even the processes are prone to instigate fire. It is therefore of utmost importance that fire prevention is well-implemented and in the unlikely event of fire, well-thought out protection is available. Intervention A state-of-the-art fire protection system has been installed at our Santej facility. It includes equipment to actively detect fire and well-established systems to control a fire if it were to ever occur. Also part of the exercise was the rationalising of components to curb the spread of the fire and training the staff. ?? Salient Points of the Fire Protection System · Extra vigilance to manage fire triggers viz. phasing out loose electrical wire. · Strengthening access to firefighting equipment and reinforcement of mock drills · Mutual aid with Vadsar Air Force Base to assist one another in the event of any emergency · Conducting various fire awareness drive viz. fire demonstration and training · Installation and revamping of fire hydrants systems as well as interconnection of fire hydrants systems · Segregation of materials incompatible with one another · Implementation of permit to work system for hot work fire safety STEAM INERTISATION SYSTEM Steam inertisation system has been installed at various processing machines at Santej facility to mitigate the spread of accidental fires.

"We have structured policies and processes under the various management standards pertaining to prohibition of employment of child & forced labour; freedom of association and right to collective bargaining; grievances redressal mechanism; working hours; remuneration; health & safety; discrimination; engagement & welfare initiatives; disciplinary proceedings etc. All such policies & processes have been communicated to all stakeholders (internal / external) in most amicable way. Also, we review the same from time to time and communicate the changes, if any, to all concerned stakeholders well in advance. A TEST OF IR EFFECTIVENESS AT SANTEJ Our Santej facility operates around the clock and in three shift operations. To keep the operations running smoothly, we have dedicated Industrial Relations professionals to oversee the shop-floor activities on a continuous basis. In addition, division-wise union representatives of the Textile Labour Association are also on-hand 24x7 to ensure smooth operations and effective redressal of grievances. Yet sometimes, despite our best intentions and robust practices, there are undesirable outcomes. In one such instance, a section of the FLMs suddenly went on a strike at the Santej plant, in October 2015. On closer examination, it was found that the agitation was being fuelled by an external labour union that had no legal affiliations with the FLMs at Santej. The strike was thus deemed illegal by both the state government as well as the honourable industrial tribunal. But while the judiciary was taking its course, the IR team swung into action and initiated a dialogue with the FLMs on strike. The issue was amicably resolved in two days with the FLMs coming back to work unconditionally. 39 INITIATIVE UPGRADATION OF FLM CANTEEN AT NARODA During the reporting period, we completely overhauled and upgraded the FLM canteen at Naroda. · A larger and better designed seating area · Enhanced hygiene standards in the cooking area as well as the seating area · Card-based access system for better management and accounting HUMAN RIGHTS To protect human rights is to ensure that people receive decent, humane treatment.

"LAYING A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR PRODUCTIVITY In the reporting period, we embarked on a new employee- excellence journey with the introduction of NEEV - a comprehensive, company-wide, competency-based standard to identify employee potential, grade their performance, and chart for them a structured career growth plan. As part of the NEEV Framework, employees have been segmented in five distinct groups based on their organisational roles. 1. Strategic leaders CEO / CXO / Corporate Function Heads 2. Functional leaders Leading Large/Multiple Functions, direct reportees to CEO, CXO, Specialists 3. Team managers Managers who have first level managers reporting into them 4. First level managers Managers who manage one or many Independent contributors 5. Individual contributors Managing work in individual capacity Requisite levels of competencies that an employee must possess under each of the group have been well-spelt out. The competencies provide an employee behaviour map, as well as identify skills that will be valued, recognised and rewarded. Training need identification, appraisal and career progression - all stem from the employee's competency proficiency level. Introduced during the reporting period, NEEV will be cascaded across the organisation in a phased manner. INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS THE CORE OBJECTIVE OF THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS FUNCTION IS TO STRIKE A HARMONIOUS BALANCE BETWEEN PERSONAL AND ORGANISATIONAL GOALS. WELL-MEANING INTENT, FAIRNESS AND TRANSPARENCY ARE THE KEY ENABLERS IN THIS JOURNEY.
